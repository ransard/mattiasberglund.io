Every employee has their own processes and tasks, whether they are documented or not. For decades, these functions have been analyzed and improved through different forms of process analysis.\nIn more recent years, advanced technology has emerged to take the analysis of processes to a new level by adapting proven business intelligence methodologies. As a result, process intelligence software has emerged as of the hottest topics in business operations. In this guide we go through key concepts, best practices as well as advanced topics.\nWhy is process intelligence so popular and what can it be used for? We’ll get into that - but let’s start first with some core definitions.\nWhat is process intelligence?\nProcess intelligence is the use of business intelligence methods and tools in business process management. Process intelligence can remove bottlenecks, improve operational efficiency, and guide business process re-design.\n\n‍\nFor a process analyst, business process intelligence is the practice of collecting and analyzing business process data to identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities. The goal of process intelligence is to improve operational excellence, streamline workflows or increase the pace of digitalization.\nFive steps of process intelligence analysis\nProcess intelligence analysis is the technology-driven analysis of process data and delivering actionable insights for process improvement. It has its roots in business process analysis - one of the core aspects of business process management.\nOn a high level, process analysis can be segmented into a number of individual steps, such as:\n\nProcess and task discovery - exploring and documenting the “as-is” state of processes in a team or organization.\nProcess mapping - the visual representation of processes based on expert interviews or software analysis.\nProcess re-engineering - the documentation of how processes should be improved to achieve set business results.\nProcess implementation - the important step of actually driving process improvements across teams and systems.\nProcess monitoring - the continuous or repeatable evaluation of how teams conform to agreed processes. \n\nIn the past, process analysis was the domain of specialized process analysts who fulfilled analysis manually based on expert interviews, surveys, or by data-crunching process information on a needs basis. Each company and analyst would have their own methods, so the analysis itself would not be as standardized. It would not be uncommon for analysis to take up to 6 months and because of the manual nature of the method, companies spend 3-5 years between process discovery audits.\nWhy analyze business processes?\nSome of the common reasons for using analyzing business process data include: \n\nProcess discovery. Discover the true state of processes within a team or organization,\nProcess analysis. Deep-dive the individual tasks or process steps within complex workflows,\nWorkflow analysis. Exploring and analyzing in more detail the end-to-end workflows in business operations,\nConformance checking. Visualize variations of key processes to map conformance to agreed processes,\nRoot cause analysis. Explore the root causes of inefficient processes,\nProcess optimization. Track progress to key process improvement initiatives and company targets.\n\nProcess analysis is a well-defined practice - and soon we’ll find how it has been taken to the next level through process intelligence software.\nWhy is process intelligence important?\nTo understand why process intelligence is important for businesses we can look at fresh research published by HFS Research.\n\nImportance of process intelligence Source: HFS Research\nAccording to a survey of executives in large (global 2000) enterprise businesses, 91% of respondents saw process intelligence as hugely significant in driving business value. Almost 86% of respondents also felt the impact of process intelligence in their business today.\nHowever, the same research points to the challenges of process intelligence technology and projects. Over 2 in 3 respondents had been disappointed in past process intelligence projects and also over 2 in 3 respondents felt process intelligence technology is too complex to implement effectively.\nA conclusion reached by many in the HFS Research and beyond is that process intelligence is hugely important for effective enterprise businesses to maintain competitiveness, while laggards in investments into process intelligence may see themselves falling increasingly behind in value creation.\nHow does process intelligence work?\nWhile there are many different ways process intelligence can be implemented, ranging from automated process discovery tools to self-built process analytics. They mostly follow an extract-transform-load (ETL) flow familiar to business intelligence solutions where raw process data is organized automatically for advanced data analysis.\n\nExtract - data is collected from enterprise resource systems or from employees completing tasks on workstations.\nTransform - the collected raw data is processed and transformed for analysis, for example through cleansing and de-duplicating.\nLoad - data is moved to a database or data warehouse where it can be analyzed and visualized in dashboards\n\nOnce the data collected is made available in a database, process mining algorithms are often applied to produce a time-and-motion view that can be visualized as a directly followed graph. In other words, the process and task steps can each be timestamped and shown in a sequence, helping the process analyst understand the flow of work.\nIn most cases, process intelligence is done automatically through dedicated software solutions that can provide real-time or near real-time analysis using web browser-based analytics.\nProcess intelligence vs process mining\nProcess intelligence and process mining are easily confused but not the same thing. While process mining software is a method to achieve the “how” of data mining process information, process intelligence is the “what” of adapting business intelligence methods to business processes.\nLet’s see it visually in the graph below.\n\nProcess mining describes the “how” and process intelligence the “what” of automated process analysis\nProcess mining is one of the most common ways to automatically collect process data for process intelligence. Other methods include task mining and Work API.\nToday many process mining vendors are also utilizing task capture capabilities and many analyst firms have recognized the different solution offerings belonging to the same use-case of enterprise process analysis. However, the solutions are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for enterprise organizations to utilize more than one process intelligence solution.\nBenefits of business process intelligence\nEach organization will have unique requirements and expected outcomes for process intelligence. Some of the most common benefits include:\n\nImproved efficiency: Business process intelligence can help to identify processes that are inefficient or ineffective, and allow for faster, more efficient process execution.\nRisk mitigation: Business process intelligence can help to identify risks and alert organizations to potential problems before they become critical.\nImproved visibility: Business process intelligence can provide an overview of the entire business process, allowing organizations to better understand their operations and make more informed decisions.\nImproved compliance: Business process intelligence can help organizations ensure they are compliant with industry regulations and standards.\nIncreased productivity: Business process intelligence can help organizations to optimize their processes, leading to increased productivity and cost savings.\n\nProcess intelligence helps enterprise leaders discover the real state of tasks, processes, and workflows today in order to improve operational excellence in the future.\nProcess intelligence is important because it provides a systematic and data-driven way to make improvements to business processes by eliminating bottlenecks, identifying automation opportunities, and improving operational efficiency.\n\nRead a case-study see how one medium-sized accounting firm uncovered over € 2 million ($2.17 million) in process waste using automated process intelligence.\n\nTools and software used for process intelligence\nIf you’re looking for a process intelligence tool you’re spoiled for choice. There are over 35 different process intelligence software solutions on the market today - and many more solutions offering task mining or different forms of process analysis and management. Broadly your options include:\n\nSelf-built process analytics running on business intelligence platforms (such as Microsoft PowerBI, Qlik Sense, or Tableau.)\nDedicated process mining software that extracts process intelligence from event logs in enterprise resource systems.\nTask mining software that collects process information from the workstations of specific teams or groups of employees.\nProcess discovery software that focuses on the discovery element of process and task mining.\nHybrid process intelligence solutions that combine process mining and task mining into the same solution.\n\n\nDownload whitepaper on how to combine process mining and task mining through a new method called Work API.\n\nProcess intelligence vs business intelligence\nWhile process intelligence can be run on business intelligence tools, such as PowerBI or Tableau, many enterprise leaders choose to go for dedicated software.\nThe key advantage of process intelligence software is the speed-to-insight, where dedicated solutions can adapt templates, integration capabilities, and process mapping that leverage built-up tacit experience of experienced business process management professionals.\nAnother advantage of process intelligence tools is that process discovery and process performance measurement can be quickly configured based on pre-existing templates. For example, many process intelligence tools offer ready-made configurations for key use cases, such as finance operations or procurement, or key industries like banking, financial services, and insurance.\nExamples of process intelligence dashboards\nBelow is a real-world example of process intelligence software in the form of a process variants analysis of an accounts payable workflow. In this popular type of process intelligence visualization, you see how a standard process is executed in different ways or process paths from start to end with average times taken in each process step.\n\nBelow you see another example of process intelligence in the form of a process overview dashboard including both process and task level insights identifying key performance indicators for an insurance company, such as cost of work and throughput time.\n\nA third example of process intelligence dashboards is the work view - where you can see the interactions of different IT systems within a process flow. You can also see in more detail where information has been transferred (eg. copy-paste) from one system to another.\n\nHow to build a case for process intelligence\nThe best way to create a business case for process intelligence is to identify the potential benefits and savings that can be achieved through the implementation of a process intelligence system. These benefits and savings can be quantified in terms of time, money, and resources. Additionally, it is important to identify the potential risks associated with the implementation of a process intelligence system, so that these can be weighed against the potential benefits and savings. Finally, it is important to assess the cost of implementing the system, as well as any ongoing costs associated with maintenance and support.\nHere are a few elements of a good business case for process intelligence:\n\nAlign your key objectives with company strategy and goals.\nGet the right people on board.\nExplain your expected benefits in simple terms.\nBuild the case on realistic costs and outcomes.\n\nUse cases for intelligent business processes\nAs you’re building a business case for process intelligence, you may consider the business value drivers you aim to communicate with key stakeholders.\nA recent study by Deloitte and HFS Research uncovered a number of use cases for process mining (and relevant also more broadly to process intelligence.)\n\n\nCreating a single source of truth / system of record for processes and workflows.\nHelping prioritize the process development backlog in a data-driven and measurable way.\nDevelopment and management of process automation techniques and tools.\nContinuous monitoring of the real-time health of your processes, workflows, and work efficiency.\nDevelopment of agile process optimization methods and helping the change management in digitalizing work.\n\nThese use cases can be applied to a variety of industries (eg. insurance or banking) or functions (eg. finance or procurement.) For more information on your use cases, request a demo.\nWhen to request an RFP?\nAs you’re evaluating your options you may consider creating a request for proposal (RFP) for process intelligence software. An RFP may help you refine the case and requirements within your organization and help identify potential software or solution providers who can match your needs.\nSome typical process intelligence RFP scoring criteria to consider:\n\nAre you looking for a process mining, task mining, or full-feature process intelligence solution that covers systems, processes, and work?\nAre you looking for a turnkey solution requiring limited implementation or more extensive deployment resources?\nDo you have or need the capabilities to deploy the solution across your organization, or will you require extensive support from the vendor or one of their partners?\nWhat is your timeframe and urgency for the project? Is it within weeks, months, or years?\nAre you looking for a solution that you can pilot and expand over time across your organization, or do you expect clear, measurable outcomes from the start?\nHow important is the solution’s current state, and how much weight do you give the vision and future roadmap of your chosen partner?\nCan you estimate the total cost of ownership of the solution based on the proposal answers, and will it meet your budget requirements?\n\n\nExample questions to ask in a process intelligence RFP\nFuture of process intelligence\nProcess intelligence is a fast-developing new technology area where we expect to see innovation and increased investment in the coming years. According to the findings from Workfellow expert interviews, here are five areas where process intelligence has a major role in the future of work.\n\nDemocratization of analytics and insights. Increasingly autonomous process intelligence solutions will reduce the need for tactical process mining and task mining. This will give business leadership and stakeholders access to the most valuable process data without the need for heavy investments in data science.\nRadically transparent business operations. As more process intelligence solutions combine process, task, and system data across end-to-end workflows, enterprise leaders can measure and improve operations in radically transparent ways across business units and teams.\nData-driven BPM led by decision intelligence. Increased process intelligence enables operational excellence teams to shift from data-informed process management to data-driven process optimization.\nThe AI-augmented workforce. Process intelligence uncovers ways that automation captures and enhances the subject matter expertise of the workforce, enabling them to focus more time on value-added tasks.\nThe fully automated enterprise. Process intelligence accelerates the adoption of intelligent automation and robotic process automation resulting in the ultimately automated enterprise.\n\nProcess Intelligence FAQ\nWhy is process intelligence important?\nIncreasingly business leaders find process intelligence as a vital enabler for process excellence as it aids organizations in understanding and optimizing their operational processes. In today’s fast-paced, digitally-driven business landscape, organizations need to be flexible, efficient, and adaptable. Process intelligence can help by identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and risks in processes. It can provide the data-driven insights needed to redesign and streamline processes, leading to improved operational efficiency, reduced costs, and better customer experiences. Moreover, process intelligence also supports compliance by highlighting deviations from standard procedures, aiding in risk management and regulatory adherence.\nWhat are the limitations of process mining for automated process discovery?\nDespite its many benefits, process mining for automated process discovery has certain limitations. One limitation is that process mining relies heavily on the quality and availability of data. If the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or not available, the results of process mining will be affected. Furthermore, process mining can struggle with complex and flexible processes. In real-world settings, processes are often non-linear and involve multiple parallel activities. Process mining can sometimes oversimplify these complex processes, leading to a lack of precision in the results. Additionally, while process mining can identify patterns and provide insights into process performance, it doesn’t necessarily prescribe solutions or strategies for process improvement. For that, the involvement of domain experts is often necessary.\nHow can you use process intelligence tools to improve process performance?\nProcess intelligence tools can be used in various ways to improve process performance. They can provide visual maps of the current processes, helping identify bottlenecks, delays, and inefficiencies that can be streamlined or eliminated. These tools can also generate metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow organizations to track process performance over time and evaluate the impact of changes. Additionally, process intelligence tools can use machine learning to predict future process performance based on historical data, enabling proactive management of potential issues. Process intelligence can also support a culture of continuous improvement by enabling organizations to test and evaluate the impact of different process design options.\nWhat is the difference between how process mining and task capture get process data?\nProcess mining and task capture acquire process data in distinct ways. Process mining extracts data from event logs stored in information systems. This means it uses existing data from business process management systems, customer relationship management systems, and other IT systems. These logs provide a detailed record of the events that occurred as part of a process, including what was done, when, and by whom. On the other hand, task capture, also known as task recording or process recording, captures process data by directly observing and recording the actions of the individuals carrying out the tasks. This can involve the use of screen recording software, keystroke logging, or other similar technologies. Task capture can provide insights into the specific steps involved in a process, including any workarounds or deviations from the standard procedure that may not be captured in event logs.\nReferences\r\nwww.workfellow.ai/guides/process-intelligence"},"1-Projects/Simulation/Process-Simulation":{"slug":"1-Projects/Simulation/Process-Simulation","filePath":"1 Projects/Simulation/Process Simulation.md","title":"Process Simulation","links":["1-Projects/Simulation/Process-Intelligence"],"tags":[],"content":"Process Intelligence\nProcess simulation is an increasingly popular area in business process management and advanced process intelligence.\nIn this article, we go through key definitions, examples and best practices every operations leader needs to know.\n\nWhat is process simulation?\nProcess simulation is a method of analyzing and improving business processes using computer-based forecasting models. Process simulation allows businesses to explore “what if” scenarios, analyze the impact of changes to processes, and identify opportunities for improvement.\nWhat is the goal of process simulation?\nThe goal of process simulation in business operations is to achieve a higher level of process efficiency, which ultimately leads to increased profitability and competitive advantage.\nProcess simulation is a powerful tool in process optimization because it is able to imitate different scenarios without disrupting existing operations. By creating a digital twin of a process, the simulation can be used to iterate and improve processes and adjust it to see what works best. This allows businesses to identify potential problems and opportunities for improvement before implementing them in the real world.\nWhy is process simulation important?\nProcess simulation helps identify areas of improvement in an organization’s processes and can be used to develop better strategies for advancing process excellence.\nProcess simulation can also be used to identify potential risks associated with new initiatives and to optimize existing operations as part of a process analysis project. By taking the time to thoroughly analyze and simulate processes, businesses can make better decisions and improve profitability.\nBenefits of process simulation:\n\nRisk Reduction: Before implementing changes in the real world, organizations can test them virtually, minimizing potential risks and unforeseen complications.\nCost Efficiency: By identifying inefficiencies and testing improvements in a simulated environment, companies can avoid costly trial-and-error in real-world processes.\nEnhanced Productivity: Process simulation can pinpoint areas of underutilization, paving the way for optimal resource allocation and increased output.\nFlexibility: Companies can easily test multiple scenarios, allowing for quick adjustments and agility in decision-making.\nPredictive Insights: Beyond current operations, simulations can provide valuable insights into how processes might respond to future challenges or changes.\n\nProcess simulation in 6 steps\nProcess simulation typically involves the following six steps:\n\nProcess mapping: This involves creating a visual representation of the process, which includes all its steps, tasks, and decision points. This representation is often developed using flowcharts or specialized BPM software tools.\nData gathering: Collect relevant data on the process being simulated, such as task durations, resource availability, and costs. This data is used to establish baseline performance metrics and to input realistic parameters for the simulation model.\nModel development: Create a mathematical or computational model of the process based on the process map and data gathered. This model should accurately represent the relationships between tasks, resources, and decision points within the process.\nSimulation runs: Use the model to simulate various scenarios, which may involve changing resource allocations, task durations, or process flows. This step helps to identify potential bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.\nAnalysis and optimization: Analyze the simulation results to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement. Based on the findings, adjust the process to optimize its performance, and run additional simulations to validate the proposed changes.\nImplementation and monitoring: Implement the optimized process in the real-world setting and monitor its performance to ensure that the desired outcomes are achieved. Continuous monitoring allows for ongoing adjustments as necessary, creating a cycle of continuous improvement.\n\n\nLooking to automate process mapping and analysis? See how to combine process mining and task mining in the Work API whitepaper.\n\nHow process simulation software works\nProcess simulation software uses computer algorithms and data science to first create a digital model of a business process and then forecast how the digital model would react in different kinds of process scenarios.\n‍\n\nVisualization of a simulation and model. Source: Danski14 / wikipedia\nBy simulating different scenarios, businesses can identify bottlenecks in their processes and make changes to reduce them. This can be used to train employees on how to best use existing systems or to re-engineer new processes.  \nProcess simulation can also be used to create a digital process twin of an organization (DTO) that mimics an entire business organization in the real world.\nProcess simulation tools\nThere are several popular process simulation tools available that cater to different industries and use cases. Some of these tools are specialized for business process management, while others are more general-purpose simulation tools that can be adapted for process simulation.

Weak links in any part of a process chain present new risks for lawsuits, fines, and even work stoppages.\n…vs Digital Twin\nA digital twin begins the same way, but in this model, data is introduced in real time. This difference means that a digital twin can be altered far more aggressively and accurately than process simulation. The digital twin can actually mature as the tester adds data and fine-tunes the process.\nA simulation shows what could happen to a product under a particular set of circumstances, but a digital twin replicates the effects changes would have on a product in the real world.

This is my take on the subject -\n\n\nDo beginners tutorials. I cannot stress this enough. Not only will this save you a great deal of time and frustration, but probably from rage quitting as well. Even if they don’t teach you the specific thing you want, after doing the beginners tutorials you will at least have a feel for the program, understand the basic navigation controls and have the vocabulary to ask the right questions. Make notes as you go, particularly of hot keys. Stop and go back as often as you need to to get it right. This is the falling off phase of learning to ride the bike. You WILL fall off. It will get frustrating. Get back on and keep pedalling.\n\n\nRepeat the tutorial from memory. Makes notes on the bits that didn’t stick the first time that you have to look up. This is the challenge, how much can you remember?\n\n\nNow make something similar, but not the same. Similar in that you don’t need tools you haven’t learned yet, but not the same so you have to start making your own choices. Instead of a donut, make a cupcake or something. This is what forces you to not just get stuck with the tutorials.\n\n\nMove on to the next tutorial. Give each one your best shot, and move on. These are learning exercise, sketches, not finished masterpieces, don’t get stuck obsessing over it at this stage as repetition of the basics is key and you won’t get to do that by spending hours obsessing over one settings. Save that for later.\n\n\nDoodle. Spend a part of your allocated daily time with blender just messing about with what you know so far. Don’t think about “making a project” that brings all kinds of expectations with it you don’t need. Just doodle in 3D.\n\n\nAsk questions. No one minds helping those who are making an effort. Tell us what you are doing, what you expected to happen, what did happen, what you did to try and fix it. Post a screenshot and include the whole Blender window - a picture speaks a thousand words. (If you are tempted to whip out your mobile phone right now, STOP, go and look up how to do screen shots eh?)\n\n\nDon’t get discouraged. Your ability to see what looks goods will advance more quickly than your ability to actually do it. This should be expected. Also don’t compare yourself to others, the only measure of progress that counts is, do you know something today that you didn’t yesterday? Can you do something better today than you did yesterday? The rest is bullshit.\n\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with the interface and the basic tools then use your end goal to direct what tutorials you do after. Most tutorials are not aimed at beginners and you will likely not have a clue what’s going on without some familiarity with the UI. I would personally recommend doing at least BlenderGurus Donut, Chair and Anvil tutorials before diving into more specific material. Other people will suggest other good sources but these are the ones I’ve done so can recommend.\nGrant Abitt is also really good and has a new Blender 3.0 Beginners Guide.

Unreviewed code may be merged into the main branch, but the presence of automated tests helps catch potential issues.

For example, if you’re struggling with music theory concepts like chord progressions or music production topics like sound design, you can ask Chat GPT for explanations and guidance.\nProblem Solving: Music production often involves solving technical or creative problems. Chat GPT can offer suggestions and solutions to common issues you might encounter during the music production process. For instance, if you’re stuck with uninteresting chord progressions, you can ask for advice on how to make them more unique and engaging.\nComplementing Traditional Learning: While Chat GPT can be a valuable resource, it’s essential to note that it complements, rather than replaces, traditional learning and mentorship. Human instructors and fellow music producers can offer unique insights and feedback that AI may not provide.\nIn summary, leveraging Chat GPT as a music tutor is a convenient and accessible way to gain insights, knowledge, and assistance in music theory and music production. It’s a tool that can help you overcome challenges, enhance your skills, and get answers to your questions at any time, contributing to your growth as a music producer.\nStart with the fundamental skills\nFundamental Skills in Music Production: Music production involves various skills and techniques, and it can be overwhelming for beginners. The advice here is to begin by focusing on mastering the fundamental skills, which serve as the building blocks for creating music. These fundamental skills typically include:\n\n\nChord Writing: Learning how to create and arrange chords, which form the harmonic foundation of your music.\n\n\nMelody Writing: Crafting memorable and melodic lead lines or themes that carry the emotional and musical essence of a song.\n\n\nDrum Writing: Creating rhythm patterns and drum sequences to provide the beat and groove for your music.\n\n\nArrangement: Structuring your music, determining where various sections (like verses, choruses, and bridges) should occur in the song.\n\n\nRecording: Capturing audio or MIDI performances using microphones or electronic instruments.\n\n\nSound Design: Shaping and designing unique sounds and textures using synthesizers and other tools.\n\n\nMixing: Balancing the individual elements of a song, adjusting volumes, and applying effects to achieve a polished and cohesive sound.\n\n\nMastering: Preparing the final mix for distribution by fine-tuning its overall tonal balance, loudness, and format compatibility.\n\n\nVocal Work: If you plan to work with vocals, this includes recording, editing, and processing vocal tracks.\n\n\n\nFor Instrumental Producers: If you’re more interested in creating instrumental music, you might prioritize skills like sound design and mixing.\n\nAvoid Overwhelm: Beginners often feel overwhelmed with the vast array of techniques and technologies available in music production. By starting with the fundamentals and gradually expanding your skill set, you can build a strong foundation and avoid getting discouraged.\nPractice and Progress: The key to mastering these fundamental skills is practice. Create small projects to apply what you’ve learned and gradually increase the complexity of your music as you become more proficient in each skill.\nIn summary, focusing on fundamental skills in music production provides a structured approach for beginners. It helps you build a solid foundation and allows you to tailor your learning to your specific goals, making the learning process more manageable and effective.\nFocus on quantity over quality when starting out as a beginner. Make a lot of music to improve.\n\n\nSkill Development: By making a lot of music, you get more practice, which helps you develop essential skills faster. You’ll become more comfortable with your music production software, learn to navigate its features, and become more efficient in your workflow.\n\n\nLearning from Mistakes: Every song you create, even if it’s not perfect, offers an opportunity to learn. You’ll encounter challenges, make mistakes, and figure out how to overcome them. These experiences are valuable for your growth as a music producer.\n\n\nCreativity and Experimentation: When you’re not fixated on making every track flawless, you’re more likely to experiment with new ideas, sounds, and techniques. This experimentation can lead to unique and creative elements in your music.\n\n\nProgress Tracking: Creating a large volume of music allows you to track your progress over time. You can see how your skills improve from one song to the next, which can be motivating and rewarding.\n\n\nTo implement this approach effectively, consider setting a time limit for each song. For example, give yourself two to three days to complete a track. Afterward, instead of endlessly tweaking and perfecting that one song, move on to the next project. Focus on improving one specific aspect of your music with each new song. This way, you&#039;ll build your skills steadily while producing a diverse body of work.\nIn summary, the “quantity over quality” approach for beginners encourages you to prioritize learning and skill development through continuous practice and experimentation, ultimately helping you become a better music producer in the long run.\nOpen your digital audio workstation (DAW) daily\nConsistency: Music production, like any skill, benefits from regular practice. By opening your DAW daily, you create a routine that helps keep your skills sharp and your creativity flowing. Even if you can only spare a short amount of time, the key is to maintain a daily connection with your music production tools and projects.\nPreventing Mental Blocks: When you go too many days without opening your DAW, you might experience what’s often called “producer’s block” or creative stagnation. You may feel like you’re starting from scratch every time you return to your music software. Consistent daily engagement helps prevent this by keeping your mind engaged with your ongoing projects.\nGenerating Ideas: Frequent interaction with your DAW encourages the generation of new musical ideas. Even if you don’t have hours to spare, just a few minutes of experimentation can lead to fresh concepts, melodies, or sounds. Over time, this can lead to a reservoir of musical ideas to draw upon.\nEfficiency: Regularly opening your DAW allows you to maintain efficiency. You become more familiar with your software, shortcuts, and techniques. This familiarity can save you time when you have longer sessions to work on your music.\nCreativity on Demand: Opening your DAW daily, even for a short time, trains your brain to be creative on demand. You learn to tap into your creative mindset more readily, which can be especially valuable when you have limited time available due to work or other commitments.\nManaging Busier Days: On days when you’re busier and have limited time, you can still open your DAW for a brief session, even if it’s just 10 to 20 minutes. This maintains the connection and keeps your creative juices flowing, preventing long gaps in your music production practice.\nSetting the Stage: Consistent daily engagement with your DAW sets the stage for more extended and focused sessions when you do have more time available. It’s easier to transition into productive work when you’re already in the habit of opening your software daily.\nIn summary, the advice to open your DAW daily in music production emphasizes the importance of consistency, creativity, and maintaining a connection with your musical projects. It helps you stay in tune with your skills, prevents creative stagnation, and ultimately supports your growth as a music producer.\nSet deadlines\n\n\nIncreased Efficiency: Short deadlines force you to work efficiently and make decisions more quickly. When you have a limited amount of time to finish a project, you’ll be less likely to get caught up in perfectionism or overthinking. Instead, you’ll focus on getting the work done.\n\n\nProblem Solving: Deadlines push you to find solutions to challenges rather than getting stuck on them. When you encounter issues during the creative process, you’re more inclined to find practical solutions because you don’t have the luxury of endless time.\n\n\nProductivity: Knowing you have a deadline looming can be a powerful motivator. It encourages you to stay on track, stay organized, and stay committed to your project, even when you might face creative blocks or other obstacles.\n\n\nCompletion: One of the biggest hurdles for many artists and producers is finishing their work. Setting and meeting deadlines helps you overcome this hurdle. It teaches you to accept that a project is “done” even if it’s not “perfect.”\n\n\nThe Half-the-Time Rule: The transcript suggests setting deadlines for half the amount of time you think you need to complete a song. This approach can be particularly effective for combating perfectionism and procrastination. By giving yourself less time, you’re pushed to work efficiently and focus on the essentials.\nApplying Deadlines in Practice: To implement this strategy, start by setting a specific date and time by which you want your music project to be completed. Be realistic about the time required but still aim to challenge yourself. Use tools like calendars or task management apps to track your deadlines.\nIn summary, setting deadlines in music production is a powerful technique to boost productivity, overcome perfectionism, and ensure that you complete your projects. It encourages efficiency, problem-solving, and a more disciplined approach to music creation, ultimately helping you become a more prolific and accomplished music producer.\nReferences\nwww.youtube.com/watch"},"2-Areas/Music/7-Habits-of-Effective-Artists":{"slug":"2-Areas/Music/7-Habits-of-Effective-Artists","filePath":"2 Areas/Music/7 Habits of Effective

Here’s Why It’s Actually Amazing\n\nExcerpt\nFor years, I kept hearing how awesome Evernote was: how it could store everything you possibly needed, make it available everywhere, and how scores of people couldn’t live without it.

[jump]\n\n\nFor years, I kept hearing how awesome Evernote was: how it could store everything you possibly needed, make it available everywhere, and how scores of people couldn’t live without it. I tried it multiple times, and never saw the appeal until now. Here’s what I was missing. [jump]\nAny time we talk about Evernote, a good number of you say the same thing: you’ve tried it time and time again, but you could never really “get into it.” I was in the same camp, but after reading the other side’s experiences in this article and its comments, I decided to give it another shot. If you’re like I was and haven’t yet experienced the greatness of Evernote, here are some things you should try.\nThe More You Add, the More Useful Evernote Becomes\nLet’s start with the most important trick: In order to see why everyone likes Evernote, it’s important to take advantage of everything it has to offer (rather than use it as just another note taker). Reader ppdd says it best:\n\nThe key to Evernote is to commit to it and jump in with both feet. It’s pretty rotten if you’re just using it for a few isolated tasks, because absolutely, it doesn’t do any one thing perfectly and it’s not as fast as other apps.\nIt really starts to show its brilliance once you start using it as your default bookmark/webclip app, notetaker, recipe box, repository of all your reference material, and so on. It’s great to have ALL the information you need indexed and searchable across every single platform you have. I love opening it up in a meeting and recording the meeting audio right along with my typed notes on my iPad. If I miss something (entirely possible while pecking things out on a glass screen) I can always return to it after the meeting.\n\nSo, if you want to give Evernote another shot, try putting everything in it that you want to hang onto. The more you add, the more useful Evernote becomes. Here are a few examples of what you could do.\nUse the Web Clipper\nI always thought Evernote’s web clipper extension was pointless. If I needed to reference articles for later, I’d just save them in my browser’s bookmarks folder or drag them to my desktop. However, that didn’t allow me to make notes on an article, or save it with other related notes on that project. Evernote solved that problem perfectly.\nTest Case: Buying a New Grill\nI just moved into a new apartment, and I need to buy a new grill. After a bit of searching, I found a few I liked but wasn’t ready to buy. I used the Web Clipper to throw its product page into a note under a new notebook, entitled “Wish List.” Now when I come into some extra money, I can open up Evernote and see my top picks at the top of my “Wish List” notebook.\nBonus tip: Evernote’s Web Clipper also integrates with Google. For example, let’s say I’m not quite done with my grill research, and I head back to Google later on to search for “gas grills.” When I do, any related Evernote clippings will show up in the right side of my search results to remind me which grills I already liked and saved. To turn on this feature, just open up Evernote’s options and check the box next to “Related Results.”\nDon’t Be Afraid to Create Lots of Notes and Notebooks\nI always tried to keep my notes to a minimum, so I didn’t get buried under an endless amount of notes that I could never filter through. Evernote is better than this, though: it manages a multitude of notes easily thanks to notebooks, tags, and note links (see below). I found that most of my “notes” should have, in fact, been “notebooks,” allowing me to store larger volumes of information with better organization.\nTest Case: Troubleshooting a Finicky PC\nI have a home server that I love, but always seems to give me problems, so it’s a “work in progress.” Back in the day, I used to keep track of this project in one note, jotting down lines from log files, troubleshooting commands I wanted to run, links to research I wanted to do, and more, all jumbled together in one big block of text. Even with some subheadings and formatting, it was still very difficult to navigate.\nNow, I have an entire notebook dedicated to my home server. Right now, it has four notes:\n\nSome sections of my server’s log, containing all the information I need to troubleshoot my most recent problem\nA web clipping from an article on the best VPN providers, since I’m installing a VPN on my home server\nA web clipping on how to install OpenVPN on my home server, since I don’t remember how to do it by heart\nA web clipping on setting file permissions, since I need to give my girlfriend access to my server’s files\n\nBecause I saved each article with the Web Clipper, I have the entire text of the article and the source link right there, plus any highlights and notes I’ve made in each. This is light years better for me than just pasting the links to each article, or trying to write everything down myself into one giant note. Plus, by creating an entire notebook, each note functions as an item in a to-do list, which makes finishing the project much easier.\nThe bottom line: Don’t be afraid to create a ton of different notebooks and a ton of different notes. Evernote equips you with the ability to easily handle thousands of notes, and what seems overwhelming will soon feel like the best organizational scheme you’ve ever had.\nBonus Tip: Create a notebook called _INBOX, right-click on it, and make it your default notebook. That way, any new notes you send to Evernote show up in this inbox, at the top of your list of notebooks, ready for you to funnel into one of your other notebooks.\nSift Through Notes with Saved Searches and Tags\nUsing tags always felt like a waste of time to me: tagging every note seemed like a chore, and serves the same purpose that filing notes into notebooks does. However, tags can be useful if you have notes that you think could fit into multiple notebooks—or are on the same subject—without getting overwhelming. You don’t need to tag every note you have, and you only need a few really important ones. It basically makes your archive easier to search through with Evernote’s advanced search operators. You can even then save those searches by clicking the little arrow next to the search bar, and pressing the magnifying glass.\nTest Case: Filter Out Family Members\nOur own Walter Glenn uses tags, albeit sparingly, to keep track of things across multiple notebooks. Both he and weblog Nerd Gap, for example, recommend creating a tag for each member of your family. That way, if you have notes across different notebooks that apply to someone besides you, it’s easy to find them through a simple search. Nerd Gap explains:\n\nI have tags for both of my kids and my wife. When I look up my son’s tag, I get everything from pictures he’s drawn for me to the results of his last check-up with the doctor.\n\nYou could also create tags for work (if your work likely spans multiple notebooks, and you want to filter out work-related notes after 5pm), to do items (since your to dos will span different notebooks), and so on. You can then save more complex searches related to those tags—say, tag:todo created:week-1 for to do items created in the last week—and access them with one click in your sidebar.\nAgain, don’t go overboard—Walter notes that tags are only really useful if you have a few that you really remember and use—but they can be a godsend once you start amassing thousands of notes. Check out Nerd Gap’s introduction to tags and search for more ideas on how to use these features.\nUse Note Links to Jump Between Related Stuff\nOnce you have more notes and notebooks than you know what to do with, Evernote can link everything together so you don’t have to search high and low for contextual information.\nRight-click on one of your notes and choose “Copy Note Link.” Then, paste that link into another note for quick access later.\nTest Case: Researching This Article\nWhen I write a long article (like this one), I create a notebook for that article. Then, I create a text note with a basic outline of how I want the article to look, with all its subheadings. As I research, I clip all relevant web articles to that notebook, highlighting all the important parts and cutting out the irrelevant stuff. Then, I’ll copy each note’s individual link, paste it in the article outline, and I’ll have a general skeleton of what that article’s going to look like, using just the stuff I’ve saved in Evernote.\nWalter notes that often, if he has a ton of notes in a notebook, he’ll just create a “Table of Contents” note at the top, where he can dump links to all the notes in that notebook, organized however he sees fit. This can be particularly helpful if Evernote’s sorting options don’t really fit your needs.\nBonus Tip: You can also drag any note to Evernote’s toolbar to quickly access the ones you use every day. That way, your most used notes are always one click away. For example, I have a note entitled “Post Ideas” that I access throughout the day, so I’ve added a button to my toolbar so no matter where I am inside Evernote, I can get to it right away.\nOther Things You Can Put In Evernote\nWe’ve talked a little bit about what you can store in Evernote, and I’ve given some examples above. But again: the more you put in, the more useful it becomes. Anything you need to save, put it in Evernote and see how it works. For example, you could use it to store:\n\nBusiness cards (which become searchable with Evernote’s optical character recognition)\nRecipes and restaurant recommendations (see also: Evernote Food)\nCode snippets or other reference material\nReceipts and serial numbers for your big purchases\nArchive whiteboard notes from your meetings or brainstorming sessions (again, all of which become searchable through Evernote)\niOS or Android “themes” that you like, if you’re a home screen customization fanatic\n\n…and of course, anything else you can possibly think of.\nIs this approach for everyone? Of course not. In fact, our own former Editor Adam Pash found the “everything bucket” model too limiting for him (and he he advocates Simplenote instead). Like most things, it depends on the kind of work you do and how your brain wants to organize that information. Sometimes, you just need a simple app with a bunch of text notes. Evernote can do that if you want—that’s part of its beauty—but it isn’t what makes Evernote special. If you’ve tried it over and over again and can’t understand what the fuss is all about, focus its more specific features like notebooks, note links, and the web clipper. You might finally find the organizational nirvana you’ve been looking for."},"2-Areas/PKM/Obsidian-Static-site-generators":{"slug":"2-Areas/PKM/Obsidian-Static-site-generators","filePath":"2 Areas/PKM/Obsidian Static site generators.md","title":"Obsidian Static site generators","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"quartz.jzhao.xyz/\ngithub.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden"},"2-Areas/PKM/The-PARA-Method-How-I-Organize-my-Digital-Information":{"slug":"2-Areas/PKM/The-PARA-Method-How-I-Organize-my-Digital-Information","filePath":"2 Areas/PKM/The PARA Method How I Organize my Digital Information.md","title":"The PARA Method How I Organize my Digital Information","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The PARA Method: How I Organize my Digital Information\n\nExcerpt\nFor years I struggled to find a system for organizing my digital information that met all of my needs. It wasn’t until I stumbled upon the P.A.R.A. method of organizing digital information that I was able to settle on a system that was just right for me.\n\n\nIn my quest to optimize my productivity, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to organize my digital information. For years I struggled to find an organizational system that worked for me. I read countless books and articles on the topic, tried a variety of different iterations of systems, but couldn’t find one that met all of my needs. A perfect organizational system would need to be:\n\nUniversal — able to receive all types of information from any source\nFlexible — able to adapt to any project or activity I would take on now or in the future\nSimple — requiring as little maintenance, cataloguing, tagging, or reorganizing as possible\nCross Platform — compatible with the variety of different applications I use as part of my productivity system\nOutcome Oriented — structured in such a way that helps move my work and projects forward\nModular — allowing me to both zoom out for a big picture view and zoom in for the details when necessary\nOpportunistic — taking advantage of work already being performed instead of requiring dedicated overhead time\n\nIt wasn’t until I stumbled upon Tiago Forte’s P.A.R.A. method of organizing digital information that I was able to settle on a system that was just right for me. P.A.R.A. stands for Projects—Areas—Resources—Archives, which are the four top-level categories in the system which all information is categorized under.\nWhile learning about and implementing the system, I naturally wrote down summary notes for myself on how to use the system. I thought these notes might be helpful to someone else trying to get “digitally organized”, so I decided to clean them up and share them. I’ve also included a link to the creator of this system’s blog which is helpful if you’d like to dive deeper into the topic.\nSummary of the P.A.R.A. System\n\nFour Primary Categories (all information is organized into one of these categories, which are listen in order of actionability)\n\nProject: A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline\nArea of Responsibility: A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time\nResource: A topic or theme of ongoing interest\nArchive: Inactive items from the other 3 categories\n\n\nProjects vs. Areas\n\nProjects → Goals to be achieved by a deadline\nAreas → Standard that has to be maintained indefinitely\nProjects always fall into Areas\nBreaking down your areas of responsibility into clearly articulated projects allows you to\n\nKnow the extent of your commitments\nConnect your current efforts to your long-term goals\nKnow if you’re making progress towards your goals\n\n\nReasons for separating projects and areas instead of using areas as the top level of your hierarchy\n\nIt is important to separate the very small amount of actionable information from the much larger amount of non-actionable information\nIt reduces visual clutter\nIt is important for projects to be stored all in one place\n\n\nIt is more important for projects to be associated with their specific goals rather than the areas they fall under\n\n\nAreas vs. Resources\n\nKeep in mind that Areas are Areas of Responsibility—There is a very clear line between things that you are responsible for, and things that you’re merely interested in\nAreas of Responsibility include:\n\nThe roles you take on in life and the hats you wear (Spouse, Mother/Father, Team Leader, Soccer Coach)\nThe ongoing standards where the buck stops with you (Product Development, Company Newsletter, Legal)\nThings that take a certain amount of constant attention (Exercise, Finances, Apartment, Pets)\n\n\nResources include:\n\nInterests (web design, crowdfunding, woodworking, frisbee golf, bio-hacking)\nThemes (psychology, politics, leadership, integrity)\nAssets (stock photos, typography links, marketing swipe file, product testimonials, code snippets)\n\n\nAnother useful guideline is to put personally relevant information in Areas, and generally useful information in Resources\n\nThis allows you to share notes from your resources without having to comb through for any personal information\n\n\nYou can connect two categories by inserting links in Area notes pointing to Resource notes\n\n\nDon’t confuse hobbies and dreams with projects and goals\n\nA project without a corresponding goal is a “hobby”\nA goal without a corresponding project is a “dream”\n\n\nDefine your project list apart from any specific tool and replicate it across every single tool you use rather than looking for “one tool to rule them all”\n\nThis approach gives you the consistency of centralization and the adaptability of decentralization\n\n\n\nThree Core Principles of P.A.R.A.\n\nPrinciple #1: The magic number four\n\nHierarchy is four categories wide (projects, areas, resources, archives)\nHierarchy is no more than four levels deep (application → stacks → notebooks → notes)\nPrevents the two primary sins of organizational overengineering: too many categories, and too many levels of hierarchy\n\n\nPrinciple #2: Mirror your task management and project management systems perfectly\n\nThis allows you to leverage the strengths of different applications rather than constantly searching for the one perfect application for your productivity system\n\n\nPrinciple #3: Separate actionable from non-actionable items\n\nThis allows for progressive disclosure—only showing the user as much information as they need in that moment—to minimize cognitive load\n\n\n\nFlows and Upkeep\n\nP.A.R.A. is a dynamic system (information flows between the four categories)\nThere are different reasons for a given piece of information (line of text, image, complete note, or entire notebook) to flow between any two of the four primary categories\nFROM PROJECTS…\n\nTO AREAS: A project can become a long-term, ongoing responsibility\nTO RESOURCES: Scan the “intermediate work” (brainstorms, notes, background research, diagrams, interview notes, etc.) generated during a project that may be useful for future projects\nTO ARCHIVES: Moving completed or inactive projects to Archives for future reference\n\n\nFROM AREAS…\n\nTO PROJECTS: Information you’ve been collecting may be useful to a new project you started\nTO RESOURCES: If you realize a note that you thought was only relevant to you can also provide value to others\nTO ARCHIVES: Archiving an area that ceases to be active (this applies to relationships)\n\n\nFROM RESOURCES…\n\nTO PROJECTS: An interest can become a full-blown project (one of the primary use cases for resource notebooks)\nTO AREAS: When you realize a piece of information in a resource notebook could apply to an area of responsibility in your life\nTO ARCHIVES: If you lose interest in a topic over time, archive the information to avoid cluttering your workspace (don’t delete it in case the interest becomes active again)\n\n\nFROM ARCHIVES…\n\nTO PROJECTS: Restarting an inactive project, or transferring useful information from past projects to use in current and future projects (one of the primary reasons to keep archived projects)\nTO AREAS: When information you collected a long time ago becomes relevant for a new responsibility you’re taking on\nTO RESOURCES: When a past project becomes an interest (moving relevant notes from the archived project to a new resource section)\n\n\n\nJust-In-Time Organization\n\nPerform organizational work opportunistically, as opportunities arise, instead of pedantically, or “just because”\nDon’t schedule reorganization on a strict timeline at set intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly)\nMake changes to your organizational structure in small batches, as you go along and happen to notice incremental improvements, not in big batches as part of a dedicated effort\n“Organizing things” represents time-consuming overhead work with no clear return or impact\n\nCan’t do it during a project as you’re racing towards a deadline\nCan’t do it after a project because it’s off to the next one\nTherefore, overhead work gets postponed again and again, until it reaches a breaking point where all systems start breaking down\nBreakdown is blamed on “lack of productivity”\n\n\nInstead, use the time when you’re already perusing your notes to also move a note that you notice would be a better fit elsewhere—given the amount of time on our devices, there are more opportunities to do this than you realize\nDon’t worry about flowing notes from one category into another with perfect precision\n\nThere is no “done”, so you don’t have to worry about what “done” looks like\nYou always have search as a backup tool to find whatever you’ve missed or misplaced\n\n\nOnce you start using this system with regularity, you will be interacting with the 4 categories with such frequency, that you will start to notice all sorts of small optimizations and changes to make information more discoverable for you future self\n\nSetup Guide\n\n5-Step P.A.R.A. Setup Process\n\nStep 1: Move existing files to a new folder called “Archive [date]” (with today’s date)\nStep 2: Create folders for each of your current projects\nStep 3: Move all the project folders into a new folder called “Projects”\nStep 4: Create a new “Archives” folder and move the existing one into it\nStep 5: Create new folders only if and when you need them\n\n\nConsistency across platforms\n\nPerform the above process for any platform where you store knowledge\nRemember to use the same titles for your projects and areas across different platforms for consistency and ease of use\n\n\nSome good questions to ask yourself when considering whether to save something\n\nIs this something that could inspire or help me if it surfaced at some point in the future?\nIs this potentially a useful source, building block, or tool for future projects?\nIs this unique, personal, or hard-won knowledge worth revisiting over time?\nIs this something that I’m unlikely to find in the future when I need it?\n\n\nWhere to save a given piece of information\n\nSave things in your digital notes app by default\nExceptions to this rule include:\n\nSensitive information: Notes apps don’t have great security, so things like passwords, medical records, or financial data should be saved elsewhere\nLarge or specialized files: Notes apps don’t handle large files well, so save them in a dedicated app (such as cloud storage)\n\n\n\n\n\nProject List Mindsweep\n\nThe Project List Mindsweep is a step-by-step exercise to help you properly identify every project in your work and life\nA project in this context is defined as: “Any outcome you’re committed to that requires more than one work session to complete”\nProject List Mindsweep Procedure\n\nDo a brain dump of everything you think could be a project\n\nYour mind\nCalendar\nTo Do list\nAgendas\nBriefcase/bag/wallet/purse\nPhysical environment\nComputer\nProcesses or procedures\nCreative opportunities\nCompetence building\n\n\nOrganize and refine your list\n\nDelete anything that is obviously not a project\nCombine projects that are tied to the same outcome\nIf a project can be substituted by a calendar entry, add it to your calendar instead\nMove “someday/maybe” projects to the bottom of the list\n\n\nDefine the desired outcome of each project\n\nWrite desired outcomes in the present tense to project yourself forward in time to when the outcome you are describing has come true (For example, Project: Schedule doctor’s appointment ⇒ Outcome: Back pain is resolved and I can sleep through the night without discomfort)\nAdd a date\n\nEvery project on your list needs to have a specific deadline or timeframe that leaves no room for confusion (such as “by June 30, 2017,” “by the end of 2017,” or “by the end of Q3 2017.”\nThis is the true test of whether it is actually a project\nEven if the deadline seems arbitrary, it serves as a reminder for you to check on your progress and reevaluate your approach\nIf there is no real deadline, add a target completion date instead\n\n\nUse action verbs\n\nWe’re looking for a verb that describes DONE: finalize, submit, deliver, complete, send, clarify, organize, update, implement, resolve, submit, reorganize, design, roll out, install, set up, publish, or complete\nIf you are using verbs such as manage, oversee, ensure, or maximize, it is probably an ongoing Area of Responsibility, not a Project\nSomething must be able to happen in the near term so that you can mark the project as “done”\n\n\n\n\nPrioritize your list by project\n\nPrioritizing by task doesn’t work since priorities are constantly shifting throughout your day and week (time spent prioritizing tasks is therefore wasted)\nProjects move more slowly, and don’t change priority even if there is an emergency, and thus is unlikely to change over the course of a week\nRearrange your Project List from most to least important for the current week\nReprioritizing this list is as simple as moving projects up or down on the list\nMake an intuitive judgment of how much of your mental bandwidth each project should be taking up this week, and sort your list accordingly\n\n\nEvaluate your Project List\n\nLook at your whole list from a bird’s eye view to see if it accurately represents your current priorities, interests, values, and long-term goals\nLook for areas you have too many or too few projects\nLook for outcomes that are important to you that don’t have projects targeted at them\nLook where you are spending time or attention with no clear outcome or goal\nFor any that are simply unclear, take a step back and ask “What am I really trying to accomplish here?” or “What bigger goal is this connected to?”\nWith this whole inventory in front of you, which projects should you cancel, postpone, renegotiate, or clarify?\n\n\n\n\nAny time you feel you are lacking clarity and don’t know where to focus, you can run through this checklist to gather up and prioritize all your commitments\nEven better, you can make this exercise into a “Weekly Review” – a standing appointment with yourself to reflect on the week and update your Project List (If you do this review from a more calm and balanced perspective, away from the chaos of the workweek, you’ll find it easier to maintain balance throughout the week)\n\nSmall-Batch Projects\n\nSmall-Batch Project (n.): 1) A tightly scoped, short-term commitment with 2) clear desired outcomes that describe end states and 3) a deadline or delivery date (which becomes a review date when passed)\nFormulating a Project List is one of the most important yet difficult exercises for most people to complete\nA Project List calls for “small-batch projects”\nCharacteristics of Small-Batch Projects\n\nTightly scoped, short-term commitment\nClear desired outcomes that describe end states\nDeadline or delivery date (which becomes a review date when passed)\n\n\nThe importance of clean edges\n\nClean edges enable focus\nClean edges enable creativity\nClean edges enable perspective\n\n\nYou can only focus on something that is distinct from its surroundings\n\nFormulating Desired Outcomes\n\nThe process-first era of productivity and our obsession with habits has led to the belief that goals are bad\nFrom prescribing means to desired ends\n\nInstead of throwing away the concept of goals, we need to reinvent them and how they are formulated\nThe key shift we need to make to formulate desired outcomes is from prescribing means to describing ends\n\nDeliver a training manual is a means\nAccelerate employee onboarding or mitigate legal risks is an end\n\n\nCharacteristics of desired outcomes as desired means\n\nDesired outcomes should be a description of the success criteria—the standards or metrics by which success will be measured\nThe desired outcome should describe an unambiguous end state\nThe outcome should have many ways of NOT coming true, allowing you to surface assumptions\n\n\n\n\nDesired outcomes as hypotheses\n\nPrecise outcomes reveal assumptions as quickly as possible, meaning they are actually hypotheses—designed to be falsified\nThe fundamental nature of goals has changed, from forecasting an outcome to formulating a hypothesis that will yield maximum learning\nArticulating and examining your assumptions allows you to learn from your projects\nThe goal isn’t to foretell the future or be overly rigid, but to be able to look at the difference between what you aimed for and where you hit, and be able to ask and answer “why?”\nBeing precise, even at the expense of accuracy, will yield the learning you need to change reality to fit your intentions.\n\n\nProjects form a network, with interfaces defined by outcomes\n\nAs you become more fluent in formulating desired outcomes, you begin to formulate a personal productivity network\nThe network is a map from where you are to where you want to be\nThe waypoints along the path are not “things that you have to do”, but instead “things that must be true”\nThere are many ways for those statements to flip from “not true” to “true” that don’t require direct effort\nMapping out the necessary conditions for a new reality to emerge means positioning yourself to benefit from unexpected opportunities\nProjects are the nodes in the personal productivity network\nDesired outcomes are the interfaces between these nodes, allowing projects to work together and become more than the sum of their parts\nThe guidelines and recommendations in this article are designed to make those interfaces as clean as possible\nClean interfaces—clear desired outcomes—are what allow a project node to rely on its neighbours\nLike Legos, not having a clean edge means it can never become a piece in a beautiful new creation\n\n\nIt’s worth adopting a standardized definition of “desired outcome” (even if you don’t accept this one) because standardizing and semi-automating the way you formulate projects allows you to ascend to a higher horizon: managing portfolios of projects rather than individual projects\n\nCore Principles of Digital Organization\n\nOrganize by actionability\n\nProjects are most actionable\nArchives are least actionable\n\n\nOrganize opportunistically\n\nAvoid heavy lifts at all costs to avoid doing upfront work of questionable value, to avoid sunk costs, and to remain as open as possible to changes in direction\n\n\nMove quickly, touch lightly\n\nKeep the investment in any given action low to nudge your organizational system in a certain direction while avoiding total commitment\n\n\nControlled randomness\n\nPrecision is only required in the definition of projects\nEverywhere else, fuzziness is encouraged\nDon’t create an internal structure for notebooks, use a standardized template for all notes, or even use a common naming convention\n\n\nComplex systems have to be grown, not made\n\nAn organizational system can’t be deployed all at once, it needs to start as a small seed that gradually unfurls and evolves to meet the changing needs of its designer\n\n\nFocus on outcomes\n\nDon’t treat the process of organizing as an end in itself\n\n\nFail gracefully\n\nFolders can drift apart for months with no real impact on productivity\nGiven the multiple mechanisms for constantly flowing notes between notebooks, the decisions where to keep notes are very forgiving\n\n\nShallow hierarchies\n\nOne of the biggest difference between P.A.R.A. and other organizational systems is its shallow depth\nInfinite vertical nesting is replaced with the horizontal movement of project turnover\nFiles are shuffled from actionable notebooks into the Archives, rather than into greater depths where we lose sight of them.\n\n\n\nThe Magic of Starting Over\n\nPeople often feel a profound rush of creative energy when they get a newly reformatted PC or a brand new Mac\nP.A.R.A. is an organizational system completely designed around the idea of starting over\nThe ideal time to “start over” is when projects are completed, so projects are the basic unit of organization\nThis ties into the idea in the “Setup Guide” of taking all of your old folders and throwing them into a dated “Archive” folder\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDo you need to create corresponding notebooks or folders across platforms even if you have nothing to put in them?\n\nYou don’t need to create a corresponding notebook for every project, area, and resource across every platform to avoid cluttering your workspace\nDo so opportunistically, when you actually have something to put in it\nThe exception to this is if the friction involved in creating a new notebook or folder will make it less likely for you to capture information at all\n\n\nHow do you decide where to put information?\n\nThe decision on which platform to put a given piece of information in depends on the constraints of each platform, and the features you need\nDigital Note-Taking Platform → Default place to store text and images\nCloud Storage → Default place to store large files or files which require real time collaboration\nOtherwise, make ad hoc decisions to use other platforms for their unique capabilities\n\n\nWhy should you break out areas so specifically?\n\nThe advantage of breaking out areas specifically is that it allows you to better determine whether or not you’re meeting your personal standard in a given area\n\n\nDo you need to keep the folder structure perfectly aligned at all times?\n\nYou don’t need to keep the folder structure between platforms perfectly aligned at all times\nFix the folder structure opportunistically or take some time to fix it when you notice the divergence is getting so bad you have trouble finding something or it is starting to impact how you work\nIt also sometimes makes sense for certain types of folders to only exist on one platform (example: Zoom Recorded Calls)\n\n\n"},"2-Areas/PKM/What's-All-the-Fuss-About-Evernote-Should-I-Be-Using-It":{"slug":"2-Areas/PKM/What's-All-the-Fuss-About-Evernote-Should-I-Be-Using-It","filePath":"2

Should I Be Using It?\n\nExcerpt\nDear Lifehacker,\nIt seems like everyone is always raving about Evernote, but I don’t really understand its appeal. Isn’t it just a notes app that other apps do better or simpler? What’s makes Evernote so great?\n\n\nDear Lifehacker,\nIt seems like everyone is always raving about Evernote, but I don’t really understand its appeal. Isn’t it just a notes app that other apps do better or simpler? What’s makes Evernote so great?\nSigned,\nJust don’t get it\nDear Just,\nYou’re not alone. I think the world might be divided into two groups: Those who love Evernote and those who don’t (or, at least, don’t understand why so many people love Evernote). Evernote is a cross-platform app that serves many purposes—it can be your digital file cabinet, note-taking tool, daily journal, task or project management system, recipe-keeper, and more. Because it has so many uses and different features, Evernote can both appeal to a lot of people and feel like overkill to others. (Our own Adam Pash has written about why he can’t get into apps like Evernote because he prefers apps that do just one thing well.)\nAlthough few other Lifehacker editors use the app, many How I Work guests and Lifehacker readers also love (and I mean love) Evernote. Heck, I use it myself. We asked our Evernote fans why they loved it so much, and here’s what they said.\nIt’s a Universal Inbox: Store Anything You Can Imagine in One Place\nEvernote integrates with just about everything. It has browser extensions that allow you to save a web page—in its entirety—in one click for future reference. A dedicated Evernote email address lets you forward emails, tweets, or any other type of content to any of your Evernote notebooks. Also, IFTTT (If This Then That) support means you can automatically send content from other services (e.g., Gmail or Google Reader or Pocket) to your Evernote account. If nothing else, you could use Evernote to archive your digital life.\nEvernote can thus serve are your “everything” inbox. Thanks to its cross-platform support (desktop apps, web apps, mobile apps) you really can offload all of your reference materials, ideas, to do tasks, or other digital items to Evernote and never worry about where you’ve collected all those random bits of information. It’s one container to store them all. Evernote’s search is good enough that you can retrieve all those docs quickly, but it also has great notebook and tagging organization (more on that in a bit) that really make it stand out.\nJay G. says:\n\nI use Evernote for EVERYTHING. I use it for my daily journal. I use it with IFTTT to save all starred items in Google Reader to save interesting articles for future reference. I scan all donation and other important receipts by scanning and emailing. I use it to organize projects with quotes, ideas, snippets from the web, and typed notes. I use it to store all digital manuals and instructions for various electronics around the home. I also use it to save favorite tweets (again with IFTTT). I use it to store teaching notes, discussion ideas, etc. I use it to reference personal documents, contracts, medical documents, etc.\nThat’s just off the top of my head, but these would be the most common uses. I am a Pastor of a church and I find this tool indispensable.\n\nChris K. writes:\n\nI use Evernote every day. I’m a consultant and often meet with clients to discuss designs. It may be weeks or months in between meetings. Evernote makes it easy to catch right back up where we left off. By synching between my MAC and my Droid I can even get caught up while I’m waiting in the lobby 5 minutes before a meeting. And I can share the notes with my peers.\n\nBasically, you can dump everything in there—from written or typed notes to photo snapshots or videos to voice recordings—and count on retrieving them later either with the reliable search or your own tagging/notebook organization.\nIt’s Digitizes Your Physical Notes and Backs Them Up in The Cloud\nBecause of its multi-platform support and OCR feature, Evernote also helps people who just want to go paperless. Mike U. says:\n\nI can answer it simply that it helps the unorganized get organized.\nBeing an Evernote premium subscriber, I use the additional upload capacity to scan receipts, bills and letters, share household notebooks with my spouse, scan our kids artwork and tag it with date/event/grade. Additionally, I use it as a repository for documentation (read:work) in searchable PDF format.\nIt is totally the one tool I use every day multiple times a day.\nThere has been numerous times I’ve been on a call and needed something like insurance information, and it was easily retrieved, because everything goes into Evernote.\n\nEvernote can quickly turn photos and scanned pics into notes—and also decipher the text in those photos. (The Evernote Smart Notebook by Moleskine is a nice marriage of the analog and digital.)\nIt’s Great for Task/GTD Management\nProductivity consultant Daniel Gold says he uses Evernote as a “life management tool”:\n\nIt allows me to leverage it as a document management tool to incubate all my reference related materials (both scanned papers and electronic) with my action items. With note linking, I can connect the dots between tasks and reference items. Add in saved searches and I can quickly filter through projects and tasks to focus on what must absolutely go right in order for me to be more productive &amp; successful.\n\nEven though Evernote lacks the typical trappings of a to-do list manager (e.g., reminders and checkboxes), it can be a worthy replacement if you set up a system for using it.\nEvernote templates make it easy to turn Evernote into a project/GTD tool, but perhaps the most thorough GTD Evernote system is previously mentioned The Secret Weapon. TSW takes advantage of some of Evernote’s unique features: multiple tags selection (e.g., quickly find: “.Active Project,” “2-Next,” “@Work”) and email integration.\nWhether you use a structure like The Secret Weapon with Evernote, Evernote could manage your tasks and projects, thanks to the easy email integration, tagging capabilities, and also notebook sharing (for collaborative project management).\nIt Rocks for Note-Taking, Whether Simple or Detailed\nA lot of people also use Evernote as a note-taking tool and for studying or reading. The app has built-in audio capture support and integrates with tools like the LiveScribe digital pen (great for students and constant meeting attendees).\nPersonally, I find the note-taking to be a bit slow and cumbersome on Evernote. If I want to just quickly jot a note down, it’s not the best tool for the job (except for the fact that it’s a great universal inbox, as above). I think this sort of dissatisfaction with easy note-taking and syncing is why a lot of Lifehacker editors have resorted to simpler solutions like using plain text files and Dropbox. (I’m defaulting to index cards.)\nStill, Lifehacker reader feedback suggests many of you are also using Evernote not just as a digital file cabinet but as a digital notebooks or notepads. Nathan A., a graduate research student in chemistry at the University of York (UK), uses Evernote as an electronic lab notebook:\n\nEach experiment I do has a dedicated note for it, and on the note I note down the COSHH/risk assessment information, safety procedures, procedures and any references I’ve used. … After the experiment, I copy up my observations, measurements etc from the lab book into the Note. This is great as it means I can write my reports with full access to my notes, and easily share a copy with my Academic or the rest of the research group.\nIt might sound a little laborious, but it ensures a contaminant-free ‘paper trail’ and it makes writing reports up a whole lot easier.\n\nMatthew B. uses it to quickly note milestones in his son’s life. And Zef C. uses Evernote to jot down recipe ingredients.\nMany readers said they liked Evernote’s ability to not only sync across all devices and organize with tags, but preserve the note creation date. And Grad student Andy K. says Evernote comes in handy when you have to compile multiple media formats into one cohesive format. (Also, did we mention it was free for all this multimedia archiving/recording goodness?)\nIt Works as a Digital Reference System, Great for Research Work or Archiving Material\nI use Evernote as a digital file cabinet and also as a place to offload and organize ideas. The web clipping browser extension works really well (although sometimes it makes me wait longer than I want to). Instead of saving just the URL, like Springpad does, Evernote saves the full article and the URL—which is great for reference purposes. With multiple tags selection and the ability to link notes together, Evernote is the ultimate reference system. As frequent Lifehacker contributor Shep McAllister says, it’s great for doing research and highlighting how different things are connected.\nIt Allows for Multiple Special Notebooks\nYou could put Evernote to any task that involves archiving, journaling, or otherwise recording information.\nAdam R. says:\n\nEvernote is perfect for a beer drinking history of the different microbrews I have had. I include pictures of each bottle or glass of beer along with tasting notes for each one.\nI also use it for work items I need with me everywhere I go, including IP addresses, network ID’s and server names. Easily searchable and hasn’t failed me yet.\n\nOthers use Evernote to preserve their:\n\nMeeting notes\nClient/project notes\nHome contractor phone numbers\nSongs (chords, tablature, etc.)\nTechnical knowledgebase\nTravel plans\nMotivational quotes\nUsernames and passwords (I might think twice about that)\nRecipes\nImportant (e.g., kids’ medical) documents\nBucket list\n\nThere are many other ways to record information, but perhaps really none as feature-rich and universally accessible as Evernote. There are tons of plugins for Evernote too, so you can pretty much mold it to your exact needs.\nThose are the main reasons/ways all of us are using Evernote. It’s not without its flaws (Alexio R. has a love/hate relationship with the app because of its automatic formatting), but it’s like the Swiss Army knife of capture tools.\nLove,\nLifehacker\nThanks to everyone who chimed in about their Evernote use!\nHave a question or suggestion for Ask Lifehacker?

Scott Bradley\n\nExcerpt\nUsing Zettelkasten to track ideas, find connections, and integrate into broader works. Thoughts on Roam Research.\n\n\nReader beware. This is a long and wonky article about writing process and tooling; basically, a review of Roam Research and a summary of a book I’ve been reading How to Take Smart Notes cobbled together. I wish I’d come across this learning manual years prior—maybe 5th grade. I mean that, studying proved hard for me. Despite this guide being focused on writing non-fiction research style journals vs fiction, I found key takeaways to help improve my own reminder-based workflow, make writing a consistent journey with no preconceived notions, and create a thread of learned knowledge from a constant stream of random ideas. And, the tooling and workflows also help at work with tracking one on one meetings, projects, and other daily diversions.\nSince college (and earlier), like most, I’ve jotted down a plethora, my favorite word from the movie Three Amigos, of notes. I always hated ruining a good book and when libraries ruled the earth one never returned a borrow marked up. Sometimes… those librarians charged me nickels and dimes for my transgressions, which was meaningful to a kid with one hand steadying the BMX bike and the other clutching a stack of books.\nAlso, the institution founded by Ben Franklin wants to prevent wear and tear. Hey, libraries loan these out 20 times annually on average. Besides, your own notes can taint the learning and joy of the next. If you imprint what you learn on a page, how will someone else find their own connections?\nTaking my local library’s lessons to heart, I avoid the inline and mark down ideas in a notebook, with pen in hand, while reading and then go back to review. Some notes are cherished while others trashed. Most sit in a strange purgatory of never being looked at again. As technology changed, I moved on from paper to using WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and Notepad. When mobile phones burst onto the scene, many more tooling options emerged. A plethora. Again, I’m not sure it means what I think it means.\nWhat is Zettelkasten?\nIf you’re unfamiliar, this is a personal knowledge management system for study. In olden times, I used flashcards for notes as I traversed in the winter cold at old Mizzou from mundane 70s style architecture at Middlebush to worse 70s style architecture at GCB. Marketing 101—The Power of Solid Copywriting. History 1—The Lives of Plutarch. Most professors dropped hints–remember this with big, bold lettering for the first test. Of course, I took note.\nBut the key learning from this book, Don’t be constrained; let the mind fly. So, I now bullet my notes and let the mind wander Take the following:\n\n“There is an obscure office in the white office that tracks each record the President keeps … When he left office, the National Archive asked for the return of this information. All due respect to the previous President, they should only have to ask once to receive the material back.” Karl Rove. Paraphrased.\nThe perfect egg salad needs Duke’s mayonnaise.\nLet’s cancel student loan debt using an obscure footnote in a law designed to help wounded veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Nah, Congress isn’t needed to speed another trillion. And then, I will go on television to berate the other party for not respecting the rule of law. Eye roll.\nBlack bears can reach speeds of 30 MPH.\nApple orchards near the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nThe next day; find time to review. On average, I often compile thirty-plus random thoughts. Then, I categorize these into topics. One idea may relate to the development of low-power nuclear energy while another is the simple task of picking up bread from the grocery store. Or, an idea from the heavens may hit to solve world hunger or start the next great LLC. Just keep writing or typing. But don’t skirt the review at the end; this is where the magic happens. Move the index cards, or cut and paste in your tool of choice, or rewrite the idea. And then tag or categorize.\nThis is important. Or key.\nHard to describe the power behind the technique. Don’t memorize flashcards. Instead, make connections, sort, and once a rhythm is discovered joy emerges. Write pages of notes, not caring about the topic. The mind is funny. It often jumps. And let it! And don’t worry about forgetting anything because the note will reappear if you are consistent with the process. It’s freeing, in an odd way.\nMore importantly, when reviewing the connection one can find out if it’s indeed meaningful. If I’m writing an article or chapter in a book, I’ll review my stack of cards. Keep some. Throw others away.\nAs a side note, I found myself disillusioned when I realized the same thought kept reappearing. But that’s the point, you are supposed to notice where your mind keeps coming back to, contemplate the connection, and then come up with a new idea or plow onward.\nTool Choices and the Methodology\nNow, despite having stacks of them, I don’t use flashcards anymore. Like I said before, technology has built many options:\nEvernote. The original tool that I’ve played with since it launched on iPhone eons back. My elephant brain. Yes, the logo fits. Running across all platforms, it has fulfilled that purpose. I used to clip from websites. Document meeting notes. And leverage it to remember things I know I’ll forget. Places to stay. Packing lists. Travel lists. Writing project lists. I like to think this piece of tech is the kingmaker of lists.\nBear. I tried converting all of my Evernote notes and giving this a go. I’ve always thought there could be a better path than the elephant tool. I also love the concept of local storage and leveraging iCloud encryption to protect how my mind works. However, this beast doesn’t do lists well. Sure, the tool can make them at ease but the cross-out feature and visualization implementation of markdown was only passable. I still check back in on the development but never could make the leap.\nNotion. A contender.\nI used to store my meanderings in a host of places–the above tools and other spots. Then, Roam Research entered the market and changed the paradigm with something simple that, reflective of the human mind, builds in a certain complexity. And because of its flexibility lets one leverage Zettelkasten surprisingly well.\nDespite start-up challenges (this is not an easy tool to use), I watched a lengthy video class and became a believer. Nobody follows instructions these days; yet, one should to save time. But note, that this is also an expensive endeavor. There are other free tools on the market with similar functionality that work including Obsidian–an open-source tool of sorts built on text files and Notion. But, I love Roam because I can pour my notes out on my daily page in bullet form, and then use backlinks to make connections. This is a simple yet powerful adjustment to the Zettelkasken method.\nOnce one is going, the flexibility of the tool in using the PAAR method to manage goals, archive, and manage projects, and changing the background layout with CSS templates is the cherry on top. This sells the tool short because one can also track workouts, write queries to build and find to-do lists, and more. Being built on top of a searchable database makes a tremendous difference. Also, I like to leverage multiple devices so being a web service goes a long way in managing the regular grind. Review notes on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.,\nThe Magic of Backlinks and Weeding the Garden\nI now have many … But once my bulleted notes are completed, I categorize my current projects using backlinks to create unique pages in the tool. These can be experiments, grand writing projects, or simple posts. The ones I’m currently driving or thinking about I often leave in the tool’s sidebar for easy access. So, take the above-bulleted list now categorized:\nDumb Things Presidents Do\n\n“There is an obscure office in the white office that tracks each record the President keeps … When he left office, the National Archived asked for the return of this information. All due respect to the previous President, they should only have to ask once to receive the material back.” Karl Rove. Paraphrased.\nLet’s cancel student loan debt using an obscure footnote in a law designed to help wounded veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Nah, Congress isn’t needed to speed another trillion.\n\nGreat Recipes\n\nThe perfect egg salad needs Duke’s mayonnaise.\n\nBlue Ridge Mountains\n\nBlack bears can reach speeds of 30 MPH.\nApple orchards near the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nHere, I categorized these topics on the pages. As I continue to bullet, I’ll come back to these ideas. I can choose to write on Great Recipes, craft a new article on how an egg salad sandwich makes stomaching awful leadership easier, or throw both in the trash can. Freeing.\nOne can add pictures, integrate Tweets, etc.,\nAnd again, the brain scans vs thinking deeply, looking for smaller details. This is why I often see myself on a Zoom call and notice a change on someone’s shelf, the matching color of the books, or displayed gun for lovers of the second amendment. The ability to ponder a topic, come back and scan, and find connections is what leads to creativity. Yes, random discoveries might have been connected on a long walk in the woods, but the earlier work allows for the idea to be conjured from the ether realms.\nAnd frankly, notes are a medium we think in, not something we think about, and how we consolidate and make these connections matters, depending on the context of where we want to go.\nRemember, It’s important to curtail your bulleted notes and categories when using the system … because if you don’t the world will nag at you. Or, oh, it’ll gnaw at you like a rabbit with no morals in a garden full of carrots. Peter Rabbit vs the Farmer. Or, remember Kevin McCarthy (minority leader)? That poor soul is like Kang at the end of Season 1 of Loki, he doesn’t know who he is supposed to be, so he’s everyone all at once. Use your backlinks. And ponder if you need the notes or not.\nThinking Like a Database\nAnother advantage of Roam is that it’s built on a database. The drag and drop function makes moving ideas from header to page extremely easy; a function that excels here instead of using a text file. As a student of the database wars–I used to sell this stuff–it may be the modern invention that changed the world. Not the internet. Or, the discovery of RNA. Don’t believe me? Think again, consider how every application uses some form of the technology.\nRows and columns allow simple mapping of ideas, which exponentially becomes a means to map human thought, the web, and creates online stores. Lego blocks. But more powerful. Thank you, IBM.\nTo-Do Lists\nOn the action item front, I look to Roam as a tool for goals vs the daily GTTRD methodology. I started this journey while testing Notion. Most of their templates have this concept, or standard pages, for, “Where do you see yourself in three-year goals? Or one year? And six months?” This is a question we often kick down the road. For myself, I somewhat split the difference with where I see myself in a year (Long Term) and six months (Short Term). For each, I listed my top three projects, which in turn support said goal. For each project, I break down dates for check-ins. Roam has this Date Picker function that tags your Daily Notes so the check-in shows when I get to the said day on the calendar. A simple; yet, powerful reminder.\nOn my Goals page, I highlight weekly action items. I try to keep this high level. What do I need to accomplish this week to keep the ball moving?\nThere are some great tutorials on Roam setup relative to daily action items. I’ve been a believer in task management/reminders for years. And I’ve created a significant amount of workflow reminding me to change the furnace filters to check on my kid’s homework assignments. I tried to migrate this function into Roam using a number of tutorials but couldn’t find a format I enjoyed. Call this a work in process. Between filters, embedded pages, etc., it’s workable but not where I see myself taking this forward on a day-to-day task management basis.\nFuture reminders are somewhat of a weakness in to-do list functions. Could be Things is the Gold Standard. However, checking lists can become an awful slog so maybe this works better? Goodness, I hate lists. Maybe, I should just scrap that. With Roam, you can do to the flexibility of the tool.\nUlysses and Scrivener, Integrating Writing Tools of Choice\nDespite the shortcomings on daily and grinding tasks, Roam shines in detailing out Projects I’m working on from long-form books to shorter articles. By leveraging metadata and page referencing, I can plan outlines and flows on individual pages by jotting down snippets as they come to mind. This is why Roam is a writer’s delight. I can just write. I don’t have to open a certain tool. As inspiration comes, I can take down the idea or write out a scene. Heck, I could even describe a leaf, noting the veins and green. And this incredible recall comes back. Based on its nature, this tool is not a dumping ground like other, glitzier tools on the market.\nThen, I can move from Roam’s slip box and working with Scrivener.\nOften, I break a larger section into smaller more manageable blocks. The process of creating a folder in Scrivener, using the function to see multiple documents in a chapter and then merge works magic. Another reason why Roam works with multiple writing tools grant the wonkiness of the formatting does show its ugly head but that’s easily fixed using features in Scrivener. It’s built to compile snippets into long-form books. They work well to together.\nI like this quote from an author, “People say to me, ‘Oh, you’re so prolific’…God, it doesn’t feel like it—nothing like it. But, you know, you put an ounce in a bucket each day, you get a quart.” Books aren’t hammered out in a day. But if you break down the problem, magic can happen. For shorter works including this post, I leverage a markdown editor called Ulysses. Specifically, the function to pull text from the iPad is an amazing cross-over feature that works well in Roam. Note, the clean-up tools are superior in Scrivener but you don’t have use to the same hammer for every nail.\nTechnical Challenges And Other Shortcomings\nFrom a consumer standpoint, Roam is very much a work in progress. You have to create many of your own workflows, processes, etc., Yes, this takes time. But I felt the payoff is worth it. So much so, that I worry that this tool may die someday if it doesn’t gain mass market appeal. May the empire never fall; otherwise, I may have to go back to old pen and paper. Yes, you can make the process work that way too. A few shortcomings:\n\nThemes, I discovered this way too late. As it uses CSS (and I’m somewhat of a CSS junkie, love to play but am not good at starting at scratch), you can change the font, background, etc., I love when other note-taking apps come out with a new design. And I enjoyed the simplicity of Bear. Well, you can have it all with how the user community has built their own. This is the power of GitHub. Clone someone’s repo to yours. Create your own CSS page. What’s even better is you can have multiple of these saved. So, I often troll the internet for new design ideas, copy the code to the css page, and filter on or off. Depending on if I want a magazine view, dark mode, or the original tried and true, a simple filter changes the mood. But, this should be much simpler. Coding CSS can be a slog for the uninitiated.\nThe Roam app is buggy. I wish it worked better than it does. External keyboard challenges using an iPad. Errors with large graphs. The list is long.\n\nThe High Level\nAnd should you use this tool? Lordy, I’m not sure how to live without these days.\nThere are a number of open source competitors, none are quite the same to me. Still, there are pieces missing that turn the tide. Templates. The setup of said templates. CSS changes. But those I consider nice to have because once I started rolling decided never to look back. And that’s what makes it special, one can tailor Roam to use PAAR, GROW, or Zettelkasken. The systems are yours to define, from the simple to the complicated.\nBut definitely read the book, the process is far more important than the tools one uses.\nOnward.\nBook Quotes and Notes:\n\n\nGood students wrestle with their sentences because they care about finding the right expression. It takes them longer to find a good idea to write about because they know from experience that the first idea is rarely that great and good questions do not fall into their laps.\nWriting is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn’t make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level.\nThe best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it’s better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do.\nWriting is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.\nIf you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head.\nYou need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. Whatever you use, it should not require any thoughts, attention or multiple steps to write it down. It can be a notebook, a napkin, an app on your phone or iPad. These notes are not meant to be stored permanently. They will be deleted or chucked soon anyway. They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture the thought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and check facts. I recommend having pen and paper with you at all times. It is really hard to beat a notebook in its simplicity.\nWe can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two.\nBut cramming won’t help you learn. As Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek put it: “If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act”\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\n\nZettelkasken. The site also recommends software aligned to the method.\nApparently, the course I used to learn Roam is now gone. But There are some nice learning features in the wild. YouTube has a number of how-to guides. Thinking someone should really take the type to convert these into a LinkedIn Learning class. Noticed this in the comments, looked like a decent option I haven’t tried.\nRoam. Evernote. Bear. Notion. Obsidian. Dynalist. Athens.\nScrivener. Ulysses. iAWriter.\nNote, I do believe one should research who builds the products we use. Your thoughts are personal. Roam is a hosted option headquartered in California. Others are not but are based in all parts of the world. Pros and cons but buyer beware. And protect where you keep your data.\nZotero. I use this to keep track of references. It’s a beautiful tool described in the book. A must-have for those writing research articles.\nEd Codd invented the relational database.\nPictures were taken near the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n"},"2-Areas/PKM/Zettelkasten-vs-other":{"slug":"2-Areas/PKM/Zettelkasten-vs-other","filePath":"2 Areas/PKM/Zettelkasten vs other.md","title":"Zettelkasten vs other","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nI also see the value in traditional approach of i.e. taking literature notes for an entire book.\n\nThere’s no need for a distinction here. A note is a note is a note, and notes can link to other notes.\nTake a look at this note. Is it not a “true” note? It doesn’t contain any text, only links to other notes.\nIn my own system my source notes (“lit notes”) start as rough notes with various writings scattered around the file, then they are grouped into meaningful chunks, those chunks are then given a title and spun out into their own focused (“atomic” I guess) notes.\nThe end result of a proper decomposition is that the source note ends up looking like Andy’s outline notes. And my best structured MOCs look that too. So in a sense a source is decomposed into a MOC, but the MOC has the title of the source. Different names for the same thing.\n\nis zettelkasten only one aspect of your PKM?\n\nUsed to be. I was a huge proponent of the ZK approach for everything. Since then I’ve evolved to something that sort of resembles PARA but not quite exactly that. This is because I’ve merged separate databases into one notes system so its easier to keep everything together.\nThis system now tracks:\n\n\nzettelkasten stuff i.e. knowledge digestion &amp; generation\n\n\nproject notes &amp; ideas\n\n\nplans\n\n\nCRM type stuff - people I know, meetings I have with them, facts about them, etc.\n\n\nplaybooks - checklists for executable strategies\n\n\nProbably more than that but this is a short list.\nI’ve found not everything fits into the ZK framework cleanly. ZK is best when you use it to digest and generate knowledge. It’s fabulous at that. But “knowledge” to me means the concepts and principles. For example, if I learn how to do Task T that is something executable so I make a playbook/checklist. But since learning Task T involves learning Principle P1, P2, … PN I make atomic ZK-style notes on those principles and store them with my other ZK-style notes in the same note system. That way my playbook for Task T can link to the principle notes as needed, and they can link to it as an example of the principles in action, etc. That means I can now have a structure for exploring the concepts in two dimensions - theory (P1…PN in my ZK “folder”) and practical execution (T1…TN in my playbooks “folder”). Maybe both grow large enough that I end up with outline notes in each - one or more outlines capturing the principles I learn, and other outline(s) capturing the playbooks showing the executable strategies.\nSo far I’m finding this approach feels much more scalable. I started with a complex system that collapsed under its own weight. Then went ultra-minimal and evolved forward using the ZK-dominant approach. But then I started encountering friction eventually again which acted as a signal that my system needed to evolve. With that I moved towards this approach which has provided a new sense of stability and opened many more doors than I previously had with the ZK-dominant approach.\nReferences\nwww.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/ssurmt/zettelkasten_and_the_concept_of_atomic_notes_are/"},"2-Areas/PKM/Zettelkasten":{"slug":"2-Areas/PKM/Zettelkasten","filePath":"2 Areas/PKM/Zettelkasten.md","title":"Zettelkasten","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Kan se kopplingar mellan anteckningar på ett sätt man inte normalt kan se, genom att länka till andra anteckningar direkt.

I don’t like having to keep my subjects separated so coursely, so I keep about 25 or so notebooks dividing my interests up into medium sized topics. Then I apply the tags. For example, one of my tags is ‘Stuff I wanna buy’. If I simply crammed all my notes into two or three Notebooks, I might have a lot of notes to look through to find exactly what it was I was thinking of with the ‘Stuff I wanna buy’ tag. However, if I break my Notebooks up a bit finer, say “Computer”, “Car Project”, “Gadgets”, “Games”, and so on, now I can go to the notebook that most likey has the note I’m thinking of, and then find the tag within that Notebook. Much faster, and less to sort through.\nBut really though, just use it whatever way works for you. It’s quite flexible and I don’t doubt that there will always be a new use that no one had thought of yet."},"2-Areas/Productivity/How-to-Increase-Knowledge-Productivity-Combining-the-Zettelkasten-Method-and-Building-a-Second-Brain-•-Zettelkasten-Method":{"slug":"2-Areas/Productivity/How-to-Increase-Knowledge-Productivity-Combining-the-Zettelkasten-Method-and-Building-a-Second-Brain-•-Zettelkasten-Method","filePath":"2 Areas/Productivity/How to Increase Knowledge Productivity Combining the Zettelkasten Method and Building a Second Brain • Zettelkasten Method.md","title":"How to Increase Knowledge Productivity Combining the Zettelkasten Method and Building a Second Brain • Zettelkasten Method","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How to Increase Knowledge Productivity: Combining the Zettelkasten Method and Building a Second Brain • Zettelkasten Method\n\nExcerpt\nLearn what “Building a Second Brain” is, how it relates to the Zettelkasten Method, and how to perfectly combine both methods.\n\n\n\nJun 26th, 2023\n\n\nRead in these languages: Deutsch English\nTable of Contents\n\nThe ultimate goal of Building a Second Brain is inner peace\n\nWho is Building a Second Brain for?\nHow does BASB work?\n\n\nThe system - PARA\nThe workflow - CODE\nThe Key Habits\n\nThe Project Checklists\n\nChecklist: Project Start\nChecklist: End of project\n\n\nReview\n\nWeekly Review\nMonthly Review\n\n\n\n\nSummary of BASB\nBuilding a Second Brain and the Zettelkasten Method in comparison\n\nPARA vs Zettelkasten\n\nBASB is a cat, ZKM is a dog\nThe restlessness of PARA\n\n\nCODE vs Zettelkasten\nHabits of BASB vs ZKM\nBASB and ZKM\n\n\nHow I use BASB myself\n\nPARA as an iceberg\n\n\nClosing words\n\nHow to read this article\nThis article is structured in two parts. First, I summarize the Building a Second Brain (BASB) method by Tiago Forte. Then, I will compare it to the Zettelkasten Method (ZKM). I will first discuss the differences, because they can help to understand BASB and the ZKM more deeply. Then I will explain how to reconcile BASB and the ZKM. Spoiler: they can be combined perfectly.\nI have made some changes in my own way of working. I will include these as examples at the end.\nThe ultimate goal of Building a Second Brain is inner peace\nWhat did Robin Hood feel when he aimed at his own arrow at the center of his target before splitting it? Of all the answers, I like the following the best: oneness with the world with a consciousness that was freed from all its contents. Zen. The perfect inner harmony.\n\nPicture by Artem Kniaz from Unsplash\nEvery form of self-management is an attempt to take a step towards this inner harmony. It is therefore no coincidence that David Allen in Getting Things Done repeatedly points to the goal of “mind like water” throughout his book. 1 Forte’s Building a Second Brain builds on the tradition of Getting Things Done. Not only does he write this explicitly. 2 It is reflected in advice like this:\n\nDon’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it. That is way too taxing and will break the flow of your concentration. Instead, rely on your intuition to tell you when a passage is interesting, counterintuitive, or relevant to your favorite problems or current project. 3 (Emphasis mine)\n\nKnowledge work is characterized by the fact that tasks are not given, but must first be recognized as such. 4 This lack of clarity about how to understand something and what to do with it leads to psychological entropy. Then, we feel nervous, uncertain, and anxious. 5\nAny form of self-management is ultimately a method of managing psychological entropy. This is also true for Building a Second Brain.\nBASB is a hybrid of (1) information management and (2) project management systems. It is based on GTD and includes customizations for collecting content for projects.\n(1) Building a Second Brain is an information management system. Processing of sources is not the focus of the system, nor is the way of processing information an essential part of the system. Even the processing method Forte proposes, the progressive summarization is not a processing method of information, but a preparation method of resources like articles, podcasts, and books for later use. BASB’s strengths lie in the management of sources of knowledge.\nWhile BASB’s “second brain” doesn’t move beyond the resource, the work with the Zettelkasten begins only after we have extracted the ideas and thoughts from the resource and put each of them on an atomic note while leaving behind the resource. This is one of the main differences between BASB and the ZKM. BASB is a system for resource management; ZKM is a method for working with ideas themselves.\n(2) Building a Second Brain is a project management system. The emphasis of the whole system on action effectiveness is particularly evident through the filing system PARA. 6 The four parts (Projects, Areas, Rresources, Archive) are aligned to a hierarchy of urgency. At the same time, a connection is made between urgency and importance because completed projects are “the blood flow of your Second Brain.” 7 Importance and urgency are the categories of projects and tasks. In a sense, the overall system speaks the “language of action”.\nIn contrast, the Zettelkasten Method speaks the “language of knowledge”. In the Zettelkasten, there is no such thing as importance or urgency. Each note merely contains ideas and their connections to other ideas. Their actionability is a second layer that we put onto them.\nWho is Building a Second Brain for?\n\nImage by Leopictures from Pixabay\nBASB is for people who want to manage their information streams and resources in a project-oriented way. But probably the most important target group is people who feel overwhelmed by uncertain tasks and modern information overload.\nIn my experience, there are two main types of overload that can be related to the two components of the temperament characteristic of openness.\n\nOverload because of Openness to Experience. Formulated as a belief set, the trait Openness to experience would read: What is new is most likely good. Because we live in an age of information inflation, 8 we are inundated with newness. People with a high Openness to Experience live in an information land of milk and honey. But people in the Land of Cockaigne are not happy. They are overstuffed and overwhelmed. They don’t know what to do with themselves. And those who don’t know what to do feel anxiety. 9 You could compare people with a high Openness to Experience to people who have a particularly strong susceptibility to fast food and sweets. Both tend to engage in erratic behaviour, which in turn can lead to anxiety-generating lifestyles.\nOverload because of Intellect. Formulated as a belief set, the trait intellect would read: Something is interesting if it is a thing that can be studied. These people love to analyze and construct. These are the ones who get lost in analyzing and constructing a perfect system. They run the risk of doing more work on their system than using it for its intended purpose. They can become overwhelmed by a self-created information overload as they build an elaborate system of RSS feeds, web clippers, and other techniques of capturing information and information resources. But they also run the risk of conducting purposeless research, neglecting project- and deadline-oriented work.\n\nBASB can provide the solution for both types of overload:\n\nIt allows managing information and resources with little effort. This helps people who feel overwhelmed with the overabundance of information and resources.\nIt is explicitly project-oriented. This helps people who lose sight of project-oriented work because they are so interested in the matter at hand.\n\nHow does BASB work?\nDisclaimer: If you already are familiar with BASB you can skip by clicking this link.\nLike any management system, BASB consists of three components:\n\nThe System. How are the folders, files, inboxes, etc. arranged?\nThe Workflow. How do the resources become the desired end result?\nThe Habits. What are the regularly recurring actions needed to take to make the system work and be maintained?\n\nLet’s start with the system.\nThe system - PARA\n\nPARA is the storage system of BASB. The acronym stands for the four containers Projects, Areas, Resources and Archive.\nIn most programs, you’d create a folder for each container. However, in some programs there are no folders. Therefore, I usually speak of “containers”. However, I understand PARA as a manifestation of a general principle of self-organization: the iceberg principle of self-organization. I will describe this in more detail towards the end.\nProjects are short-term efforts in work and personal life. They are what you are currently working on. 10 They have characteristics conducive to work:\n\nA beginning and an end (unlike a hobby or an area of responsibility). 11\nA concrete result to be achieved and consist of concrete steps that are necessary and together sufficient to achieve that goal. 12 Example: Achieve 100 kilos in the bench press.\n\nAreas (of Responsibility) are concerned with anything that you want to keep in mind for the long term. They differ from projects in that you do not pursue a goal with them, but want to maintain a standard. Accordingly, they are not limited in time. One could say that they represent an aspiration on ourselves and our living world. 13\nExample: Health and Fitness.\nResources are topics that might become relevant or useful at best in the long run. 14 They are a catch-all container for everything that is neither a project nor a responsibility. Resources are: 15\n\ntopics that are interesting, 16\nsubjects to be researched, 17\nuseful information for later use, 18\nhobbies. 19 (Note: I consider hobbies to be an area of responsibility because hobbies also have standards).\n\nExample: A workout plan to try at some point.\nThe Archive is for everything inactive from the above three categories. 20 It is a storage for things finished and postponed. 21\nExample: An old training plan.\n\nTying it all together: Areas of Responsibility and their projects and tasks, applied to two example areas.\nThe four containers are sorted by action relevance: 22\n\nProjects are most relevant to action because you are currently working on them and have a deadline. 23 The fact that you have to have a deadline is not the deciding factor, only that you are actively working on them. My personal criterion for this is that I sit down at least once a week to work on the project.\nAreas of responsibility have a longer time horizon and are therefore not immediately relevant for action. 24\nResources become actionable only in specific contexts. 25\nArchived stuff is inactive until it is needed. 26 Therefore, it is hardly relevant to action.\n\nThis four-folder system is kept simple for a reason: Complex systems usually require complex maintenance. PARA abandons this complexity. CODE, BASB’s workflow, is similarly kept simple.\nThe workflow - CODE\nThe BASB workflow is divided into four steps:\n\nCapture includes everything you fill your inboxes with.\nOrganise means filing in the PARA folder system.\nDistill means processing of resources with the method of progressive summarizing.\nExpress means the application or publication of content.\n\nForte does give some tips on Capture. However, I do not consider them essential to understanding BASB. Therefore, I will not go into them in detail.\nOrganize is the step where we empty the inbox and incorporate the resources into the PARA system. In doing so, we use the hierarchical nature of PARA: We first check if the resource can be used for something urgent and then work our way to less urgent: 27\n\n\nGo through all active projects first. Is the resource useful for the project? If yes, file it under this project.\nIf not: Is the resource useful for an area of responsibility? If yes, file it under this area of responsibility\nIf not: Is the resource useful as part of a resource container? If yes, file it under the respective resource container.\nIf not: Archive the resource.\n\nDistill describes the way the resource is processed. Here, Forte recommends the progressive summary: 28\n\nAcquisition is counted as the first step of processing. That is: the resource is filed. In Forte, this is already achieved at capture. However, I think it is better to assign this step to Organise. Only when we have filed the resource in the PARA system can we speak of a first edit.\nRead the resource and mark in bold the passages that catch our eye.\nHighlight what seems to be extra important from what is already marked in bold.\nThe last step would be the executive summary. This means that you list the most important key points of the resource at the beginning of the document.\n\nThis is where the difference from the Zettelkasten Method becomes particularly obvious. At no point in CODE do you move beyond the resource inside the system. Only at Express, the next step of CODE, do we leave behind the resource as the unit of information.\nWith BASB, we get stuck with managing resources because we don’t move beyond the resource. Yet, the method of resource editing is quite easily interchangeable. Even if we process the resource to the point of extracting out each individual thought, as is the case with, let’s say, the Zettelkasten Method, we could still fit the individual thoughts into the PARA system as well. So, progressive summarization is not at all an essential ingredient for BASB to work.\n\nDon’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide wether to highlight it. That is way too taxing and will break the flow of your concentration. Instead, rely on your intuition to tell you when a passage is interesting, counterintuitive, or relevant to your favorite problems or current project. 29\n\nBut the progressive summary is in the spirit of a way of working: The progressive summary could almost be seen as a technique for not letting knowledge work distract you from a project-oriented way of working. We will see more about this in the comparison of BASB and the ZKM. Progressive summarization does not involve thorough extracting and processing of ideas.\nExpress means that Forte encourages us to actually use our system for something. Forte gives some tips in this section such as breaking up larger projects into small steps that are easy to work through. 30 But this step is already outside the actual system of processing and management because most likely you will start writing in your dedicated writing app or implement behavioral changes in your life and not in your second brain.\nThe first three aspects Capture, Organise and Distill concern the input to the system PARA. Express states that we should use the system to its fullest effect. With PARA and CODE, we covered the system and the workflow. Now, let’s continue with the first of the key habits.\nThe Key Habits\nSystem-relevant habits are actions that are necessary for the effectiveness of the system, and therefore must be done regularly. As with all project and task management systems, there are two types of habits.\n\nHabits of good use of the system. Through these habits, one derives maximum benefit from the system. In BASB, these are the project checklists.\nHabits of maintenance of the system. By these habits one repairs the current damages and signs of wear. In BASB, these are the reviews.\n\nThe Project Checklists\nThere are two checklists: one at the beginning of the project and the other at the end of the project. The checklist at the beginning of the project is for using the system to its fullest extent for the current project. The checklist at the end of the project is for using the completed project to improve the system. 31 So, these two checklists are designed as positive feedback loop:\n\nChecklist: Project Start\n\nCollect: Gather your thoughts about the project. What do you already know about it? What don’t you know? What is your goal? What people can you tap into? What are possible resources? 32\nReview: Search the folders of your second brain for useful information. 33\nSearch: Use the global search to back up the second step. Sometimes, useful information turns up in surprising places. 34\nMove: Move all relevant notes to the project folder. 35\nCreate: Create an outline from everything you have collected in the project folder. 36 Important: You are only planning the project. You’re not working on it directly yet. 37\n\nChecklist: End of project\n\nMark: Mark the project as complete in your task management and still process any loose ends. 38\nCross out: Mark the goal associated with the project as achieved and move the goal to a “Achieved” list. You can use this list of achieved goals as motivation. 39\nReview: Review the project folder for content that you can use for other projects.\nMove: Move the project folder from “Projects” (PARA) to the archive (PARA). 40\nIf project is becoming inactive: If you cancel or postpone the project, make sure you can start where you left off. Create a note, with all the necessary information, how you would continue and also with the reasons why you stopped. 41\n\nReview\nAll systems get cluttered and deteriorate if they are not maintained. Forte explicitly follows the tradition of David Allen’s GTD here. 42 I consider these checklists to be fairly self-explanatory.\nWeekly Review\n\nEmpty the email inbox. 43\nView the calendar. 44\nClean up the desk of your computer. 45\nEmpty the inbox of your note-taking software. 46 There is no editing involved! This is just about putting the material into the PARA system.\nChoose the assignments for the week. 6\n\nMonthly Review\n\nView and update your quarterly goals. 47\nView and update your project list. 48\nView your areas of responsibility. 49\nView your “someday/maybes.” 50\nUpdate how important and urgent the tasks are. 51\n\nSo we have all three aspects system, workflow and habits together.\nSummary of BASB\n\nBASB is a hybrid of (1) information management and (2) project management system. It is based on GTD. The important changes are the adaptations for collecting content for projects.\nThe system PARA is a four-folder system ordered on a hierarchy of relevance to action.\nThe workflow CODE mainly concerns the input to the system. However, use of the system for publishing is encouraged.\nUsing the project checklists is the core habit for productive use of the system. The system is maintained on a regular basis. This is what the weekly and monthly reviews are for.\n\nNow that we have an overview of Building a Second Brain, we will compare this system to the Zettelkasten Method.\nBuilding a Second Brain and the Zettelkasten Method in comparison\nSimplified, BASB is a source material feeder system for project-oriented self-organization. It is especially suitable for people whose projects are particularly dependent on source material. Oddly enough, the processing of knowledge seems almost to be considered a necessary evil, to be automated and simplified as much as possible. Thus, Forte writes in the processing step Distill:\n\nDon’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it. That is way too taxing and will break the flow of your concentration. Instead, rely on your intuition to tell you when a passage is interesting, counterintuitive, or relevant to your favorite problems or current project. 52\n\nAnalysis, interpretation, and classification of resources and the thoughts they contain are essential to the processing of knowledge itself. It could not be clearer: The processing of knowledge, knowledge work, is explicitly not part of BASB. Knowledge work needs to be done, regardless, if you want to actually produce value. So, you will perform the actual knowledge processing outside the BASB system.\nThe Zettelkasten Method, on the other hand, is a method for processing knowledge. The analysis of single thoughts and their relations to each other is clearly a centerpiece. Project work, on the other hand, is in the periphery. In a way, the ZKM is agnostic to the use of the processed knowledge. We could spend a lifetime working with a Zettelkasten without publishing a single line of text.\nLet’s go through the three aspects in order to elaborate on this:\nPARA vs Zettelkasten\nThe system PARA is a filing system arranged by time relevance to action. Projects come before areas of responsibility because they have a short to medium time horizon, while areas of responsibility have an unlimited time horizon. Resources and Archives come last because they are usually neither a priority nor urgent.\nThe Zettelkasten Method is based on a hierarchy-free network. There are individual notes and their links. The structure notes can be used to create a hierarchy, but they are rather a just one representation possibility for a set of notes. One can create other structure notes with alternative hierarchies or even some with a non-hierarchical representation. In the Zettelkasten, one’s thoughts find an equal coexistence.\nBASB is a cat, ZKM is a dog\nLet’s say you want to breed pets. They are to be companion animals that keep people company. Both dogs and cats have been companions to us humans for thousands of years. But the way they form a relationship with us humans is completely different. This first decision, whether I breed dogs or cats, is a fundamental one. Certainly over many years of breeding I can make cats more obedient, loyal and stable in temperament. I can also make dogs more ignorant and moody after many generations. 53 But fundamentally, dogs and cats have two completely different basic ways of relating to humans.\nThat’s the difference between BASB and ZKM. BASB speaks the language of action. ZKM speaks the language of knowledge. The basic categories of BASB are importance and urgency. These are categories of action. The basic categories of ZKM are atomic thought and its relation to other thoughts. BASB chooses as its filing categories PARA, a folder system that is a hierarchy of urgency. ZKM is a heterarchy of thoughts that can float freely in the ether like in the Platonic world of ideas.\nForte places himself in the tradition of David Allen’s Getting Things Done. 54\nCompleted projects are considered the blood supply of the second brain:\n\nI’ve learned that completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second Brain. They keep the whole system nourished, fresh and primed for action. It doesn’t matter how organized, aesthetically pleasing, or impressive your notetaking [sic!] system is. It is only the steady completion of tangible wins that can infuse you with a sense of determination, momentum, and accomplishment. 55 (Emphasis mine)\n\nAnd last but not least: Progressive summarizing, Forte’s proposed method of processing resources, is just a method of highlighting a text. At no point does it leave behind the resource. Thus, not only is it not processing resources into knowledge, it is merely preparing resources so that they are easier to skim.\nPARA brings in an element of restlessness.\nThe restlessness of PARA\nPARA is not based on an assumed correctness of filing (for example, on a sophisticated metaphysics of categories). It is a production system that puts information where it is most likely to be needed. Because this is constantly changing, the whole system is subject to constant upheaval and reordering: 56\n\nPARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to find the “perfect place” where a note or file belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system is constantly shifting and changing in sync with your constantly changing life. 57\n\nResources and notes have no fixed location, but are always moved to where they seem to make the most sense. If one relates the three active folders (projects, areas of responsibility, resources) to each other, one could say that the internal purpose of the areas of responsibility is to supply the project folder with projects. The metaphor of blood supply that Forte chooses to describe the role of completed projects is perfect: “The blood supply to the brain is of absolute importance. Without blood flow, neurons die within minutes. If the project folder is not supplied with projects, the second brain dies. The central task of the user is to complete the projects and thus return the blood. Otherwise, your brain will suffer from a stroke.\nI see a side effect of this as a problem. This dynamic brings a certain restlessness into the system. Nothing has its fixed place. For individual, small projects, this is not a problem. However, anything that is complex and exists over a long period of time needs stability and constancy. We need familiar places. This familiarity comes from going to these places and always being assured in the same way, “Everything is fine. Nothing changed. You are still welcome!”\nMy research on psychological entropy is a good example of what BASB is inappropriate for:\nIt took me a few weeks to build up the sections of my Zettelkasten that cover the topic of psychological entropy. In the language of BASB, this was a research project. While I did not have a firm deadline, I had two clear goals. First, I wanted to achieve “Feynmanian clarity.” 58 That is, I wanted to understand the phenomenon to the point where I could explain it to someone without stuttering. Second, I wanted to build the structures so that I could smoothly incorporate new knowledge in the future. I wanted to create a place that seemed like an old acquaintance. The first would still have been compatible with BASB, but the second goal was not.\nNot only do I have many such research projects. They also span disciplines and years. When I do a research day, I may well combine the results of 5 or 6 such research projects. This means that within hours I have to access knowledge that I have built up over a span of 10–15 years. If the knowledge were spread over folders in my second brain and I was forced to re-collect such amounts of knowledge, my work would not be possible. I would be too slow. If I have an idea, it must be realizable at this moment. I can only do that with my Zettelkasten, but not with the PARA system.\nForte recommends relying on system-wide search. 59 But my experience with the Zettelkasten Method has shown me that as the size of the Zettelkasten increases, the search function becomes less reliable and more cumbersome to use. I’m already at the point where the search function has lost much of its usefulness. My Zettelkasten is simply too complex for the search to provide reliable access.\nThis problem is by no means only relevant for people like me. It results from the relationship between knowledge and the user. The problem described above always arises when one works at the limits of one’s own cognitive capacities. It is only a matter of time before one reaches this limit when using a system for a lifetime. For some, this point arrives after a few years and for others after 10 years. But one thing is certain: It will arrive.\nThis does not mean that BASB is useless! BASB provides a system for information and project management. It provides tools to meet requirements upstream of resource processing. BASB is something like a combination of forestry system and lumberyard. The Zettelkasten, on the other hand, deals with the actual processing of knowledge. The Zettelkasten Method, on the other hand, a carpentry.\nBASB is a hybrid of (1) information management system and (2) project management system. The Zettelkasten Method is a system of creating an integrated thinking environment and working with it.\nOnce you understand this difference, there is nothing to stop you from using both methods in combination!\nCODE vs Zettelkasten\nThe workflow CODE is a method of filing edited resources. At no point do you move beyond the resource inside the system. One could argue for it happening at the express step. But this is technically outside the system.\nIn contrast, the core of ZKM is precisely this processing of resources into individual ideas by extracting them from the resource and connect them to other ideas. Preparing the resource for later use is indeed a feeder method, and publishing content with the help of the Zettelkasten contributes to using and integrating the Zettelkasten. But both of them nevertheless belong to the periphery of the Zettelkasten.\nThus, one could superimpose both methods and clarify this difference:\n\nThey focus on different sections of the overall value chain of processing knowledge.\nHabits of BASB vs ZKM\nHabits of BASB are the typical habits of an administrative system. It must be used in a certain way, and it must be maintained regularly.\nThe Zettelkasten Method is frugal as far as that goes. Rather, there are mere habit recommendations, such as setting up research days. But the Zettelkasten Method is rather another way of doing what you are already doing anyway. Therefore, there are two basic recommendations:\n\nUsually, you should not do anything in addition, but do what you are already doing with the Zettelkasten. Once you have learned the basic handling of your Zettelkasten, there should be no extra work.\nWorking with the Zettelkasten benefits greatly from incorporating Newport’s deep work strategies into your daily routine. While these strategies are general recommendations to everyone, they fit the Zettelkasten Method especially well.\n\nBASB and the ZKM are two completely different approaches to working. But their differences don’t come from the fact that they solve the same problem differently, but that they address different parts of the knowledge-based value chain. This makes them not only easily compatible. In fact, I think it is advisable to combine them. That way, you get the best of the worlds of productivity-focused self-organization and deep understanding-focused integrated thinking environments.\nBASB and ZKM\nLet’s look at the above graph again:\n\nFrom this graph, we can see that BASB manages exactly what is outside the Zettelkasten. BASB is not about creating a second brain in the direct sense. Rather, it is about handing off to the system all that does not belong in the brain. Again, BASB is in the tradition of GTD and accomplishes the same thing.\nThe system and workflow of BASB and the ZKM are easily compatible. We use BASB for organizing resources and excerpts. Our Zettelkasten serves as our integrated thinking environment. Here we process the collected resources and excerpts into atomic thoughts and link them together.\nFrom the PARA system, the Zettelkasten is responsible for both resources and the archive. Projects and areas of responsibility are divided: Content belongs in the Zettelkasten, tasks in the task organisation.\nThe project habits can be easily transferred to ZKM.\nThe routine at the start of the project would look like this:\n\nCreate a structure note for your project in the Zettelkasten. This is the place where you collect everything. The difference is that you just create links to needed notes instead of moving the actual files. This applies to notes anyway, but also to excerpts and resources in the form of PDFs, books, etc.\nCollect: Collect everything you know about the project on the structure note.\nReview: Search your notebook for existing knowledge and refer to it from your project structure sheet.\nSearch: Systematically search all other places. (Like collections of unread PDFs, link lists, etc.)\nMove: Moving to a project folder is unnecessary. All notes stay where they are.\n\nThe result is a note that contains all information about the project. It refers to all notes that are relevant for the project. However, it also references resources and excerpts that are outside the Zettelkasten. So, you process everything until you have one structure note that just links to notes and comments on them and their relationships.\nThe routine at the end of the project, would look like this:\n\nMark and Cross Out are part of task management and have nothing to do with the Zettelkasten.\nReview and Move are already partially done, in extreme cases even completely: After all, you have developed all thoughts in the Zettelkasten. They are already in the Zettelkasten and completely integrated into your base network. For every note you write, you can check directly when you create it whether the note is usable for another project. When you finish the project, there’s one thing you can check: if something came up while you were writing the manuscript that you want to feed back into the Zettelkasten. That’s what I call “processing back.”\nIf project becomes inactive is superfluous. Everything is in the Zettelkasten anyway.\n\nBASB’s maintenance habit review has nothing to do with processing knowledge, but with project and task management. We use the habits to clean up the PARA system. The Zettelkasten remains unaffected.\nMy personal lessons from reading Building a Second Brain are as follows:\nHow I use BASB myself\n\nThe inbox is coming back. I have reintroduced inboxes. Originally, I eliminated all my inboxes and immediately put everything into the right place. I actually dislike inboxes, but have accepted them as a necessary evil. I found that I did stay in the workflow more easily when I experimented with using an inbox again after reading BASB. However, I now have to work on my resentment of emptying the inbox regularly.\nReviews are coming back. Because I have an inbox again, I have to do reviews again – at least to empty my inbox. In my task management, the task is “Clean up the workspace” and consists of 4 subtasks: (1) throw the browser tab addresses into the inbox, (2) empty my task management inbox (I use Things), (3) clean up my desk, and last but not least (4) clean up my study.\nAn old routine is coming back. (“Verzettelungsroutine”) Originally, I had my own version of Feynman’s 12 Favorite Problems. I had a collection of notes on various topics and projects that I basically checked for possible linking opportunities when I created a new note. After a long hiatus, this is coming back.\nI have darlings. I use PARA as a basic principle for organizing resources and tasks. I manage resources and short notes with TaskPaper. Originally, I had a purely thematic ordering. I have now abandoned this in favor of a variation of the PARA system. I just call them my darlings because they are not just problems but, as in the case of a short story collection, creative projects.\nI have switched from TaskPaper to Things. Things is faster, less complex, and provides ready-made task management functions. I am not a professional task manager. Having once lost two weeks to Emacs, I don’t want to make such a mistake again. Things is inspired by GTD. It’s a great fit. The only thing I’m missing is the complexity that TaskPaper allows. That’s important for some of my long-term research interests, where there are complex dependencies that I map by deep indentation. But there’s already a solution in sight: TaskPaper will take over my long-term research.\nI value effectiveness more. I have changed my work style to more effectiveness (publishing) and less efficiency (basic work, indirect work).\n\nHowever, I do not follow one recommendation: Forte recommends using the PARA structure across all programs. Forte reasons, personal knowledge management systems should follow the same patterns as the task and project management system because they have the same job: They are productivity tools.\nMy Zettelkasten follows a completely different logic than my task and project management system. Even my research file, where I collect promising resources, article ideas, and the like, does not strictly follow the PARA system, but rather an ARA system. I have divided the projects I have assigned to the areas of responsibility by size within the areas of responsibility. Small items are not only easier to accomplish, but are often part of larger research and writing projects. So, within the areas of responsibility, I have divided the projects according to their size and thus achievability.\nStrictly speaking, I do not follow PARA, but an overarching principle. I understand PARA as an incarnation of this overarching principle: the iceberg of urgency.\nPARA as an iceberg\nIn my view, PARA is a version of a general principle of task hierarchy:\n\nImportant projects are urgent.\n\nModels such as the Eisenhower Matrix suggest that the importance and urgency of tasks and projects are two independent properties. While this is true in the short term, it is not true in the long term. For example, it is urgent that I clean up my workspace today so that I have a clean start to next week. But cleaning up is not important compared to finishing this article. Tidying up is urgent because the mess is screaming at me right now, but it’s not important. I could go on working in the mess for years. Completing this article, on the other hand, is an important milestone for the Zettelkasten Project. Whether I finish it a week earlier or later, on the other hand, makes little difference.\nIn the long run, over years and decades, important projects are always urgent. It may not be urgent that I publish this article next week. But while I could put off cleaning up for life, publishing this article can’t wait more than a month.\nThe principle Important projects are urgent! is a second-order principle that arises from the application of the Eisenhower matrix: It can be used not only as an inventory of the general situation, but also as a guiding principle for how we should shape our lives. We should shape it in such a way that we do as few unimportant things as possible. This increases the meaning and significance of our lives. We should treat the important but not urgent projects as if they were urgent. This makes us productive.\nThis results in a unifying hierarchy that combines importance and urgency.\nPARA follows exactly this principle. The areas of responsibility are what is important but not urgent. Yet they continually produce projects that we treat as urgent. Indeed, projects have a specific goal and usually deadlines. PARA is a way to continually transform important but not urgent into important and urgent. I think this is one reason why BASB works as a productivity tool.\nPARA has a kind of iceberg dynamic. Only the smallest part, the projects, float above the surface. The rest remains hidden below the water’s surface. But below its surface, water freezes onto the iceberg and makes it larger. As a result, the iceberg gains more buoyancy and more of it protrudes above the water. The areas of responsibility and resources give the overall system a greater buoyancy. In a sense, they push projects above the surface of the water into our consciousness. And if you want to stretch the metaphor a bit, the ice above the water can be mined and drunk as precious fresh water.\n\nMy above criticism of unrest is put into perspective at this point. Unrest is a necessary side effect of urgency. This systemic restlessness is balanced by the ongoing focus on projects. While working with BASB’s second brain, we fixate on the projects at hand while ignoring the rest of the system’s restlessness. We can ignore the restlessness because it is hidden from us. Most of the iceberg remains under the water. The folders for areas of responsibility, resources and archive remain closed.\nMy Zettelkasten provides the necessary peace and quiet for knowledge work. It gives me a firm foundation. The restlessness of PARA does not affect my Zettelkasten, only my resource management. For my overall system, the purpose of my PARA is to provide resource collections, sorted into projects. PARA replaces my old system here, sorted by topic, and directs my research toward specific projects. This dynamic helps me through two possible directions:\n\nWhen I assign a resource, I go through a hierarchy of actionability. That is, the resource is filed where it is most likely to benefit a project.\nThe more resources I assign to larger and therefore more difficult to implement projects, or even general areas of responsibility, the more likely I am to structure the project into subprojects. This leads to a larger project being divided into smaller and thus more actionable sub-projects, or even to projects emerging in areas of responsibility.\n\nClosing words\nBuilding a Second Brain 60 and the Zettelkasten Method concern completely different sections of the knowledge-based value chain, starting with the world’s resources and culminating in publications and their practical implementation.\nBASB concerns the management and rough preparation of resources for later use and then proposes to proceed from prepared resources directly to publication and implementation. This means that the actual knowledge work must take place in the manuscript.\nThe Zettelkasten Method, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with the actual knowledge work and suggests that resources be processed thoroughly and deeply so that ideas and their connections to each other are revealed in Zettelkasten. This shifts the knowledge work into the Zettelkasten.\nThe two methods are easy to combine because of their little overlap.\nFor me, the reading Building a Second Brain had a similar effect to reading Deep Work 60 by Cal Newport. Both books prompted me to improve my system. I have been working with BASB as part of my overall workflow for a few months now and am very pleased. I can give a clear recommendation."},"2-Areas/Productivity/Introduction-to-the-Zettelkasten-Method-•-Zettelkasten-Method":{"slug":"2-Areas/Productivity/Introduction-to-the-Zettelkasten-Method-•-Zettelkasten-Method","filePath":"2 Areas/Productivity/Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method • Zettelkasten Method.md","title":"Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method • Zettelkasten Method","links":["202005201056","202005201057","202005201058"],"tags":[],"content":"zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/\n\nOct 27th, 2020\n\n\nRead in these languages: English Chinese\nTable of Contents\n\nLuhmann’s Zettelkasten\n\nWhy Are We So Interested In Luhmann’s Zettelkasten?\nThe Fixed Address of Each Note\n\n\nA Zettelkasten Is a Personal Tool for Thinking and Writing\nThe Anatomy of a Zettel\n\nThe Unique Identifier\nThe Body of the Zettel\nOther Examples\nReference\nPutting the pieces together\n\n\nConnecting Zettel\nStructure Notes\nHow to Implement a Zettelkasten?\n\nChoosing Software\nThe Paper-Based Zettelkasten\nThe Archive\nDokuWiki\n\n\nStarting Now\nSpecial Thanks\n\nWhy are you reading this introduction? The chances are that you either have an immediate need to solve the riddle of knowledge work, feel overwhelmed by your master’s thesis, try to level up your blog, want to write a book because it’s cool, try to get on top as a consultant, excel at research, or something like that. But the Zettelkasten Method is more than just a tool to finish some work or project. It is a holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life.\nThe Zettelkasten Method is an amplifier of your endeavors in the realm of knowledge work. It is highly effective, and many people report they have more fun, one even comparing it to the addictive nature of games like World of Warcraft, and have an easier time doing knowledge work overall. But this only comes as a result of putting in a high level of consistent effort.\nIt is like swimming. If you can’t swim, you won’t be having any fun at all. Swimming sucks if all you do is float (or even sink) and fight the water. But boy, if you figure out the technique and glide through the water, it is incredible. But you don’t learn swimming by aiming for ease and fun. You learn to swim by aiming to be fast and graceful.\nThe Zettelkasten Method needs some practice. First, you will have the feeling that you don’t do anything useful. But with a little bit of practice and patience, you will surprise yourself and produce gems of knowledge.\nThis introduction is meant to guide your first steps towards excellence. Follow this path and your Zettelkasten will provide you with the tools to thrive on intellectual adventures.\nIf I had to explain to someone unfamiliar with the concept of Zettelkasten, I’d describe it like this:\n\nA Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.\n\nThe Zettelkasten, as we know it today, really took off with Niklas Luhmann, the godfather of the Zettelkasten Method, the most powerful tool for thinking and note taking out there.\nLuhmann’s Zettelkasten\nNiklas Luhmann was a highly productive social scientist. He published 50 books and over 600 articles. 1 He didn’t achieve this on his own. He had quite a companion.\nThere are also over 150 unfinished manuscripts left in his estate. At least one of them is a text of 1000 pages. So his productivity surpassed even his already astonishing body of published work.\nLuhmann himself stated that his productivity stems from working in a partnership with his Zettelkasten. This strikes a chord with people investigating the Zettelkasten Method. 2\nLuhmann’s Zettelkasten is a collection of notes on paper slips with a special twist: It is a hypertext that he could navigate the drawer cabinet containing all the paper slips with a reasonable amount of time and energy. “Reasonable” means that it was reasonable for Luhmann, who, obsessed with his theory of society, was a workaholic and an enthusiastic bureaucrat. A hypertext needs to be surfable. On Wikipedia, you just need to click a link to get to the next article within Wikipedia’s hypertext. It requires more effort to follow a link if the hypertext is paper-based. The other problem is that you need a starting point for your ride. So Luhmann created his Zettelkasten to make his note collection surfable. He needed entry points and a mechanism to surf from one note to another in a productive way.\nWe are lucky because we have access to powerful digital tools. Handling a physical Zettelkasten is way more difficult and labor intensive than a digital one. We don’t have to be bureaucratic workaholics to reap the benefits of the Zettelkasten Method.\nWhy Are We So Interested In Luhmann’s Zettelkasten?\nFirst, we fantasize about what it would mean to be as productive as Luhmann. Luhmann’s Zettelkasten seems to inspire people, which is one of the main drivers why interest in his method of production is surging.\nSecond, Luhmann’s Zettelkasten promises to be quite an improvement to run-of-the-mill approaches to note-taking and knowledge work in general. It amplifies your effectiveness. It is possible to produce more in less time, but not with less effort per time. If we accept this we can improve ordinary note-taking methods in several ways:\n\n\nWe can improve the connectivity of our thoughts. The hyper-textual nature of the Zettelkasten enables us to connect ideas. These connections make new insights possible. Insights don’t happen in a vacuum. They are the result of making new (unexpected) connections.\n\n\nWe can be more productive. The Zettelkasten Method streamlines our workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. This, in turn, decreases friction. It is quite common to enter a stage of flow which further increases productivity. I even allocate two days per week to make Zettelkasten work my priority and allow Zettelkasten flow to happen.\n\n\nWe stop wasting our efforts. Even if you don’t use any of your notes for a project you’re working on at the moment, you prepare the knowledge for future projects. At the very least, you improve the depth of processing information from that topic.\n\n\nWe can tackle more complex problems. It is very difficult to keep all the balls in the air if you juggle complex problems. The Zettelkasten Method allows you to concentrate on a small part of the problem and after that take a step back and look at it with a panorama vision.\n\n\nNormal note-taking will create a bloated mess over time. The Zettelkasten on the other hand will scale itself automatically to the size of the problem you are tackling. This is what Luhmann talked about when he wrote about “internal growth” (I translated it into “organic growth”) in his manual.\n\n\nThe Zettelkasten Method will make your writing easier, more coherent, smoother and more convincing. One of the main problems in writing and thinking is our limited capacity to follow one line of thought for a long period of time. Just think of meditation. It is even difficult to focus on a simple thing like breathing for a couple of minutes. Imagine how difficult it is to think about one issue for weeks and months to write a thesis. The Zettelkasten will hold your thoughts alive and help you to hold onto them.\n\n\nWe have to make notes to wrestle with problems effectively. To put it in Luhmann’s words:\n\nWhat are we to do with what we have written down? Certainly, at first, we will produce mostly garbage. But we have been educated to expect something useful from our activities and soon lose confidence if nothing useful seems to result. We should, therefore, reflect on whether and how we arrange our notes so that they are available for later access.\n\nThe result of Luhmann’s own note-taking effort was his Zettelkasten. Let’s dive in and see how he achieved this to extract some general principles.\nThe Fixed Address of Each Note\nIf you want to refer to an individual note, it needs to have a fixed and unique address by which you can identify the note. It is necessary to make the actual lookup possible. In our digital age, we rarely think of this problem unless we are software developers. We are used to performing a search on the web, and in a fraction of a second, our search presents us with the results. When you deal with a bunch of paper notes, however, you need to make it possible and bearable to get anywhere at all. Luhmann’s approach was a clever numbering system.\n\nLuhmann’s numbering system allowed to make sequences and intersperse notes between adjacent notes through adding another character to the end\nThe very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that is not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you want to continue the first note, or inject something into its content, comment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note would get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you would go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would create a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a train of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand, intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new character. For this to work, you alternate numbers and characters. 3\nLuhmann’s numbering system has two consequences for re-creating his method:\n\n\nIt makes organic growth possible. Luhmann didn’t use the term hypertext, but he probably would if he lived today. This organic growth is also precisely how wikis and their wiki-link feature works. You have a text but want to expand on a point. You branch off from the current page, and thus basically inject another text into the current one, but at the same time hide its contents.\n\n\nIt makes linking possible. The emphasis on linking is a more obvious hint at the hyper-textual nature of his Zettelkasten. The non-linear link structure is the main trait of a hypertext. In his manual on how to create a Zettelkasten, he wrote: It is not important where you place a new note as long as you can link to it.\n\n\nHis numbering system made a paper-based hypertext possible. It worked with a bearable amount of effort for Luhmann.\nAt this stage, we have a surfable hypertext. But we do not have something like a search engine to enter the hypertext. “Where to start?” is a question Luhmann needed to answer. He used his register as the place to start, his entry point.\nLuhmann’s register could be mistaken for a tag system. However, the individual notes were not tagged, nor did he put a tagging system in place to organise his Zettelkasten.\n\nThe register of Luhmann’s first Zettelkasten\nThere are very few IDs per item in his register, sometimes just a single one, next to each term. His register is purely a list of entry points, not a tag list. For example, the term system had just one entry. This is a huge surprise when you consider that Luhmann was developing a systems theory where this term played a huge role all over the place. The register was only a list of possible entry points to the biggest and most important clusters of notes. After finding the entry to his hypertext, he relied on the linking system and began to surf.\nThe fixed address of each note is the alpha and omega of the world of Zettelkasten. Everything becomes possible because of it.\nIf you want to replicate the functionality of Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, you would have to create a hypertext and limit your entry into it via the most central pages on a topic, from which you would continue by following links.\nIn contrast to other approaches, Luhmann decided against making his Zettelkasten stiff and opted for an organic approach instead. There’s a reason his own manual is titled “Communicating with Slip Boxes”, and not something like “A slip box as a writing and thinking tool”. Our point of reference is that The Zettelkasten Method is an organic and non-linear, even living, approach on note-taking.\nLet us begin with the most important traits of a Zettelkasten:\n\nIt’s hyper-textual.\nIt adheres to the Principle of Atomicity.\nIt is personal.\n\nFirst, it is some kind of hypertext, not a single text or just a collection of texts, but texts that refer to each other, explain, expand and use each other’s information. The difference between regular note-taking systems and a Zettelkasten is the emphasis on forming relationships. A Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority. The difference between just a text and hypertext is that the former is linear and the latter is organic.\nTo become a hypertext, a Zettelkasten requires multiple texts, or notes, that you can connect via hyperlinks. We call an individual note a Zettel. Zettel is the German word for “paper slip”. They are the smallest building blocks of the Zettelkasten.\nEach Zettel needs a unique address by which we can refer to it, to make connections between Zettels. Then there can be hypertext and the note-taking system can qualify as a Zettelkasten.\nSecond, a Zettelkasten needs to adhere to the Principle of Atomicity. That means that each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge and one only. These units are the atoms to which the principle of atomicity refers. To figure out what the atoms are, it helps when we ask ourselves what we want the molecules that we create from our note atoms to look like. What are the units that have their own address? The answer is: One thought. Let us explore some examples that do not use thought as their atoms.\nBooks, for example, have addresses and cross-references. They have chapters, sections and pages. All have unique numbers that can be referred to. However, you cannot refer to a thought, an idea or any content. Chapters, Sections and Pages are more like coordinates. A thought might spread over the whole book! You cannot refer to it directly with just one reference. A book is not a web of thought.\nWikipedia, also, is not a web of thoughts, because you can only link to articles and sections within them, but not to individual thoughts inside the text. None of the addresses matches with any thought. Wikipedia is not meant to be such a thing. Rather, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia with each article containing information on a topic. Wikipedia is not a thinking tool but a tool for information retrieval.\nIn contrast, referring to an atomic note is unambiguous: when you reference it, you will know what the ‘thought’ is. There should be no room for guesswork. That is what the rule of atomicity means: Make sure that the layer of content and the boundaries between notes match and are well defined. Then and only then can it be a reference to an address identical to referencing a thought.\nThe Zettelkasten is a tool for thought, thus it needs to treat individual thoughts as its base unit. In order to connect individual thoughts, give each thought an address to refer to. In the words of us “Zettlers”: Create one Zettel per thought.\nThird, there is one Zettelkasten per person, and one person per Zettelkasten. Thinking is a different process from communicating with another person. You want your Zettelkasten to be a personal thinking tool. If you don’t keep your diary absolutely private, you wouldn’t write some things down, and you’d filter other things, therefore distorting them. Writing for yourself is and should be different from writing for the public.\nThat does not mean that it is never useful to create a shared, project-specific hypertext. But that is not what we are talking about when we talk about a Zettelkasten.\nThat brings us back to our short definition:\n\nA Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.\n\nWith that, we have a working definition. How do you Zettelkasten-ify your thinking and writing?\nThe Anatomy of a Zettel\n\nWhat does an individual note, a Zettel, look like? There are three components that each Zettel has:\n\n\nA unique identifier. This gives your Zettel an unambiguous address.\n\n\nThe body of the Zettel. This is where you write down what you want to capture: The piece of knowledge.\n\n\nReferences. At the bottom of each Zettel, you either reference the source of the knowledge you capture or leave it blank if you capture your own thoughts.\n\n\nIt is really that simple. If you are doubting if you are doing it right always come back to the simplicity of these basics. All you need to enable the hypertext, the bare minimum, is an address, that is the unique identifier, and of course some content in the note.\nThe Unique Identifier\n\nThe unique identifier (ID) is mandatory to create a Zettelkasten. Only with a unique identifier you can address Zettel individually. Only with that capability, you can create a web of thoughts that will assist you with your endeavors in knowledge work.\nThere are several ways to identify notes, the most common are:\n\n\nThere is of course the Luhmann-ID. You create some kind of arbitrary hierarchy wherein each Zettel has a place where it could be. Using a paper-based Zettelkasten, I recommend using this technique because it helps to deal with its organisation. The other types of ID wouldn’t work as well for paper.\n\n\nYou could chose a Time-based ID. With a digital Zettelkasten, unlike with a paper-based one, there is no real place for a note. To create the hypertext, you need an address, but not a place. A time-stamp is a very simple way to create a unique string of numbers to which you can refer. A sample time-based ID would be: 202006110955. Year 2020, 11th of June, 9 am and 55 minutes.\n\n\nYou can use any arbitrary unique string. You could just use an incremental number, execute a program that generates a random but unique string, or whatever else you want. The main reason for me to consider this over time-based IDs is the promise to shorten IDs. For example, if you encode the date and time as a hexadecimal number, 202005191402 could be shortened to 2F08729AEA. This is a direct translation of the timestamp. That would shorten the string by two digits. There are more ways to make it even shorter than that. But you’d sacrifice some simplicity, and you wouldn’t be able to produce an ID manually. Also, this sacrifices human readability of the time of Zettel creation. Therefore, we do not recommend that approach.\n\n\nYou could also use the title of the Zettel as its ID. As long as it is unique, it can serve as an ID. Consequently, you cannot change the title unless you change any reference to it if you want to keep your links intact. There is some software that would handle this problem for you, but we do not recommend this. We prefer a software-independent approach and keep our independence from software.\n\n\nThe Body of the Zettel\n\nThe body of the Zettel contains the piece of knowledge you want to capture. It could be an argument, a concept, or anything along those lines.\nThe most important aspect of the body of the Zettel is that you write it in your own words. There is nothing wrong with capturing a verbatim quote on top. But one of the core rules to make the Zettelkasten work for you is to use your own words, instead of just copying and pasting something you believe is useful or insightful. This forces you to at least create a different version of it, your own version. This is one of the steps that lead to increased understanding of the material, and it improves recall of the information you process. Your Zettelkasten will truly be your own if its content is yours and not just a bunch of thoughts of other people.\nThe length of a Zettel is directly tied to what kind of hypertext you want to create. Do you want to create a web of excerpts? Then a Zettel should contain precisely one excerpt. Do you want to make a web of thoughts? Then a Zettel should contain precisely one thought. A Zettel is the base entity that has its own address. Therefore the length of the Zettel, what you consider the atom you want to create molecules from, is determined by the objective you want to achieve. Your thinking operates in units of thought. A Zettelkasten can capture your thoughts and their relations as you design it that way. Therefore, we recommend limiting each Zettel to one thought each. Then your Zettelkasten will assist you in thinking instead of just assisting in creating excerpts.\nIn the Zettelkasten forum, @Nick asked how selective I am and what the nature of the information I put in is. Well, that depends on what you are thinking about. I recommend that you stick to knowledge instead of information.\nThe difference between knowledge and information, in practice, is quite simple. Information could be summarized in one sentence most of the time. Most of the time, it is “dead”. Information just is.\nAn example of a piece of information could be:\n\nAt this time (2020-05-20 09:14), I, Sascha, create the first draft of an article which has the working title “Zettelkasten – An introduction”.\n\nWhat do you do with this? As a historian of the Zettelkasten Method, you could process it for a timeline of introductory articles on the Zettelkasten Method, to track the topic as it unfolds on the internet. Then you would create an empirical base of information for your historical work. But as a mere statement, it is quite useless. To most of us, it is just dead information and not knowledge.\nAs a rule of thumb, you should always make something from the information you process. You should always translate information to knowledge by adding context and relevance. Even if you don’t use the created knowledge directly, as long as you enrich the information with relevance you are on the right path. You don’t need to worry about what Zettelkasten forum user @grayen wondered in the context of taking notes from articles on the internet:\n\nI sometimes struggle to determine whether it is worth writing a detailed Zettel about what makes the website worthwhile to write a Zettel about, but I don’t want to write for the sake of writing, and most of the time I am not sure if it is just transient stuff or whether it really is useful to keep around long term and not just for the processing of a particular thought/query I had. I don’t want to turn my Zettelkasten into busywork, i.e. a kind of procrastination. (slightly edited)\n\nIf in doubt, write the note, within the confines of your deadline. If you knew whether or not every piece of knowledge would be relevant to your final product, there would be no reason to take notes, because you would already have the final product in your mind. Every bit of knowledge you add has the potential to be useful in ways you might not be able to see in the moment you produce it.\nIn practice, you need to compromise between taking broad notes and focussing on your current projects. You cannot just take random notes on what you are interested in and expect to get anything done. So, use your current projects as golden threads to guide your work while allowing a bit of deviation from this path. The amount of deviation depends on what your deadline is.\nThe benefit of this habit is that you can maintain a flow of writing much more. I cannot count the many good ideas and texts I wrote while technically working on another project. By keeping the flow going you will produce more useful thoughts and text in the long run. The limits of this practice are the how much you need to achieve in the short-term.\n\nThe path to a finished project produces all kinds of byproducts\nThose byproducts are not waste. In the long run, they become valuable knowledge for your future projects. Also, they form connections to other parts of your Zettelkasten and will enrich your personal learning experience while working with the Zettelkasten.\nExample: I have a long-term book project. It is a very comprehensive book on nutrition which is part of a series on living a healthy life. One chapter was dedicated to the integration of nutrition into the other areas of responsibilities: Stress, training, everyday life organisation etc. I let myself loose and the result is that I wrote a whole book from this chapter.\nOther Examples\n\n\nIf you are working on your bachelor’s thesis and are pressed for time, allow very little deviation and do focus on the source material relevant to your thesis.\n\n\nIf you are a retired mechanical engineer who spends your well earned free Sundays in a forest barn with your Zettelkasten to work on a novel, allow as much deviation from the project as you wish. Enjoy your time!\n\n\nIf you are a nurse who wants to publish a small book on how to deal with the healthcare system, don’t stress so much to get focused work done. You are doing so much for all of us already, you should enjoy the writing process and satisfy your intellectual curiosity, even if this slows down your progress.\n\n\nIf you are an ambitious type-A personality, allow room for deviation as much as you can endure. Your personality will ensure that you come back quite fast to the source material that is relevant for your project anyway.\n\n\nWhether you should work focussed or allow deviation isn’t much of an issue of the Zettelkasten Method but more an issue of circumstances in your general life.\nReference\n\nAt the end is the definition of the citekeys in the MultiMarkdown syntax. Here, it is referenced once in the very last line of the body.\nThe reference part at the bottom of your Zettel states the sources of the information. The footer is the right place for external sources like books or articles from the web.\nTo manage the references, use reference management software like BibDesk. It will contain the bibliographical data and provides you with citekeys. Citekeys are similar to IDs. They are identifiers by which you can point to the reference you are using (One common format for a citekey is [#lastnameYEAR]).\n\nSometimes, however, you will refer to other Zettel as your source of inspiration. In that case, you base your thoughts on something you have already processed in the past. You reference the Zettel by linking to it via the ID, connecting the new to the old.\nIf you have no reference at all, perhaps that means you wandered through the forest and had a sudden insight about the true nature of the world. In that case, you don’t need to do anything in this reference section. If no reference is given in a Zettel, it is your own thought by default.\nPutting the pieces together\nSee this picture with all the elements pointed out.\n\nAll the parts of a Zettel together\nUp to this point, we have only looked at the individual Zettel. Now, let’s take a look at the relationship between Zettels.\nConnecting Zettel\n\nThe Zettel to the left links to the one to the right via its unique ID\nThe true magic of a Zettelkasten, when compared to ordinary note-taking systems, comes from the heavy emphasis on connection. Each new Zettel needs to be placed in some relationship to another Zettel. Luhmann further stressed the importance of connecting every new Zettel:\n\nIf there are several possibilities, we can solve the problem as we wish and just record the connection by a link [or reference]. Often the context in which we are working suggests a multiplicity of links to other notes. […] In such cases it is important to capture the connections radially […], as it were, but at the same time also by right away recording [backlinks] in the slips that are being linked to. In this working procedure, the content that we take note of is usually also enriched. (from “Communicating with Slip Boxes”, emphasis mine)\n\nThe main benefit from connections is their effect on you and your brain: When you relate pieces of knowledge to others, you create relationships between pieces of knowledge. Knowledge relationships significantly improve recall, and forming them also trains your mind to see patterns.\nLet’s say you read an article about anthills and think: “Wait a minute. That looks like the organization of the factory I own!” You draw many connections about the parallels you see between your factory and the anthill. Why do you see those connections? You see them because there is a typical pattern that can describe both the anthill and the factory. And some may contain more than what you do know: hypotheses on what is yet unknown. Could there be particularly efficient pathways in the anthill, and you could similarly adapt your factory layout to make it operate more efficiently, too?\nAs you connect, you will learn, understand, and thus expand yourself in two ways: (a) Your knowledge will increase and (b) you will be a better observer. By being a better observer, you will be able to draw more insights from observation. More universal patterns arise and become more apparent to you. A fundamental aspect of working like this is that it allows you to access the general patterns of reality.\nTo make the most of a connection, always state explicitly why you made it. This is the link context. An example link context looks like this:\n\nExample Zettel with two examples of link contexts\nThe first paragraph adds context to the link. The link references a note that explains why liquidity needs to be first priority if you start investing. The link context is the explanation that comes after the link itself. I explain to my future self what to expect if he will follow the link.\nThis type of connection is where one of the leading knowledge creation mechanisms of the Zettelkasten is found: The meaning of the link, the why of the link, is explicit. The explicit statement of the why is created knowledge.\nIf you just add links without any explanation you will not create knowledge. Your future self has no idea why he should follow the link. One might think now that the links are placed for a good reason. However, if you create a web of thoughts where you cannot be confident that following a link will lead you to something meaningful, then surfing your own thoughts will give you a feeling of disappointment. Your future self will judge its past self (you!) as unreliable.\nIn short, to collect connections without an explicit intention, captured meaning, or statement of relevance is not knowledge production, and as a habit, it is even counter-productive: You make shallowness of work a habit and lower your skill as a creative knowledge worker in consequence.\nStructure Notes\nA Zettelkasten should not only be a web of thoughts that you create from the bottom up of Zettels and their connection. Some sort of hierarchical structure is very useful. Luhmann himself needed to tackle this problem, too.\nWe can have a look at how he used his register. Not each relevant Zettel was listed for each keyword. Only the most central Zettels that served as entry points to a topic.\nAlso, Luhmann had hub notes. These are Zettels that list many other places to look at for a continuation of a topic. Luhmann’s Zettelkasten posed a severe challenge in getting to all the relevant parts of a search, especially compared to a digital Zettelkasten.\nThe main benefit of hierarchical structures is the increased potential for knowledge creation. Structuring your knowledge is a very productive method to get a bigger picture. Let’s explore The Structure Note as it is one of the ways to add structure to a zettelkasten.\n \nA Structure Zettel with fancy table-of-contents markup, and a graph view of the same connections and hierarchy.\nA Structure Note is a Meta-Note: it is a Zettel about other Zettels and their relationships. Luhmann’s hub notes served as fast tracks to navigate through the web of notes. The same is true for Structure Note. For example, I have a Structure Note about The Zettelkasten Method. It is similar to a table of contents specifically made of all my Zettel on the topic. Whenever I write a new Zettel on the Zettelkasten Method, I make sure that I place a link to it on this Structure Note, or on a Structure Note that is itself referred to by the main Structure Note on the Zettelkasten Method.\n\nA part of a list of general models in my Zettelkasten\nAnother Structure Note of mine is about general models. Each Zettel notes a separate schema about various mental models. Two examples for illustration:\n\n\nThe obstacle model. It is a general view of the need to increase energy output to transition from one state to another. One application is the phenomenon of hunger. In nature, you need to increase your energy output (hunt or gather) to move from the state of being hungry to being sated. Concentration is another use case. It could be modelled as the ability to increase and focus your mental energy output on moving from an incomplete to a complete task.\n\n\nThe chemistry model. Its gestalt is a molecule that has atoms as parts. Atoms are the parts which are assumed not to be divisible into smaller chunks. A molecule is the composition of the elements. The Zettelkasten Method is a model of this application. Another application is Ido Portal’s teaching methods of skills.\n\n\nThe chemistry model is both a part of the Structure Note on general models and in the Structure Note on the Zettelkasten Method itself. Those overlaps in zettels create a semilattice structure:\n\nUnlike a strict tree, a semilattice can have cross-connections from one branch to another.\nIn reality, even the semilattice does not capture what is really going on in the Zettelkasten. The right model would be one of heterarchy. 4 But that goes beyond the scope of this introduction.\nStructure Notes are not limited to hierarchical structures like the nested list from above. Structure notes can also have sequential structures. Imagine the following line of argumentation: a -&gt; b -&gt; c, therefore a -&gt; c. A Structure Note could capture this sequence and link each step of the sequence to a Zettel which expands on it. An example, with annotations to point out each step:\n\n(a) The stimulation of surface cold receptors is (b) the main driver of cold adaptation.202005201056 Cold showers stimulate the surface cold receptors sufficiently.202005201057 Therefore, (c) cold showers are a viable method of practicing cold adaptation training.202005201058\n\nThe links via [[ID]] refer to Zettels that are compilations of evidence for each statement. The structure of the arguments guides this Structure Note.\nTo recap: To create Zettels about the relationship between other Zettels, is called a Structure Note. The practice of creating Structure Note will further train your ability to deal with general patterns of knowledge. Capturing the results in your Zettelkasten so they will be available for later use.\nHow to Implement a Zettelkasten?\nChoosing Software\nIf you choose software to handle your Zettelkasten, there are some features the software should have. Below is an essential checklist for features you should look for:\n\n\nThe software needs to make hypertext possible. There are two ways to accomplish this. You either use whatever linking feature the software offers – this is often more convenient for less tech-savvy people –, or you stick to the imitation of direct links through full-text search. The search-based approach is more robust over time and across apps, but perhaps a bit more awkward to get used to. See our demonstration how TextMate would handle links. Keep in mind that I didn’t modify TextMate in any way to accommodate the handling of a Zettelkasten.\n\n\nThe navigation between Zettel will depend on two things: Full-text search and being able to follow links. The full-text search is an equivalent of finding entry points via the register in Luhmann’s Zettelkasten (more powerful, obviously). Links are just links as you know them. No further explanation needed. A full-text search is an advantageous option a digital Zettelkasten has, but an analogue Zettelkasten doesn’t, which results in the heavier usage of it.\n\n\nA kind of sandbox. An implicit part of Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was his desk. He could just pull out any number of Zettel and arrange them on his desk as he liked. You can’t do this so easy in the digital version. In The Archive I use Structure Notes as my desktop. The arrangement is more hierarchical and not so free like physical slips of paper. But it does the job.\n\n\nThe Paper-Based Zettelkasten\nIf you chose to make your Zettelkasten paper-based, just follow the approach by Luhmann as he fleshed it out in his article “Communication with slip-boxes”.\nI started my Zettelkasten journey this way and experimented with it for a couple of months. Immigration to my digital solution was quite painful. There is no automation for that unless you have very legible handwriting and can use optical character recognition (OCR) on the notes or an assistant who transcribes them for you.\nThe Archive\nOne of the main concepts of The Archive is the software-agnostic philosophy and adherence to a simple plain text approach.\n\n\nSoftware-agnosticism is the principle that you make the opposite of what boxing-in tries to achieve. There are direct ways to box you in, for example, by storing notes in a closed-off file-format that no other software can decipher. But there are also implicit ways to make it difficult to change the software, for example by making the export process difficult, or by training the user to depend on features that are not available anywhere else. One example of how we try to avoid this is our decision to make the search function responsible for carrying out a lot of the features. Even Zettel links boil down to search. Full-text search is omnipresent on computers, and therefore you can reproduce your workflow with about any plain text editor in the world.\n\n\nThe plain text approach is the paradigm of using plain text files as the primary storage. Plain text is the most versatile and durable file format.\n\n\nIn sum, The Archive manages a folder of plain text files. You access your files by performing a search via the Omnibar.\nIn The Archive, an individual Zettel should look like this:\n\nShort, formatted Zettel in The Archive\n\n\nThe ID of the Zettel is both in the filename and in the contents of the file. The main reason is to create redundancy. A use case for this practice is to access your Zettelkasten from anywhere: back in the day, I used Dropbox to access my notes from other computers. Dropbox allowed a filename-based search only. Therefore, I needed to put the ID in the title to make it possible to follow a link via the search function of Dropbox manually.\n\n\nThe ID is time-based. It never changes, so you can change the title as much as you want without breaking any links.\n\n\nIf you follow a link, you perform a search for the ID inside the double square brackets. So you can follow links with any software that can perform a search. Linking in The Archive works by putting the ID in double brackets.\n\n\nThe tags are hashtags. If you click on the highlighted hashtag, The Archive will perform a search for that tag. Tags are nothing but strings that group notes via a shared phrase that you can search for.\n\n\nThe Archive uses Markdown for marking up text. It is very readable by humans and at the same time widely adopted in tools that integrate plain text with publishing methods. Many text editors support Markdown, and you can use other tools to produce nice-looking PDF-files. Markdown comes in handy if you want to write an article or assemble a small presentation.\n\n\nCitations and book references are added via the extended MultiMarkdown syntax. It connects beautifully with BibTeX, which is a widely-supported format to save bibliographic data in plain text files. Our recommendation for Mac is the open-source tool BibDesk and for Windows JabRef to manage the bibliographical data and connect it to the Zettelkasten via the citekeys it produces.\n\n\nAll the screenshots here are examples of our Zettelkastens in The Archive.\nDokuWiki\nDokuWiki is one of my favourite software solutions for managing a Zettelkasten. If you use DokuWiki, you could consider not making each Zettel its own wiki page. The design of the DokuWiki user interface is more tailored towards long(er) pages. This violates the principle of atomicity to appoint. However, if you link directly to subsections and each subsection contains one thought you will be fine. Every page can be divided into sections and subsections, each with its address, making it possible to treat sections as individual Zettel.\nDokuWiki allows you to use title-based IDs and keeps the links functioning if you change the title names, hence the IDs. I still recommend to additionally use time-based IDs. They would just come up in the address of each site or subsection but wouldn’t be in the way otherwise. The benefit is that you will be able to export DokuWiki to another software (especially text editors) solution much easier. Think of the time-based ID part of the code of the Zettelkasten itself which can be read by various software. If the code is complete you can use a high number of apps. If you decide against some parts of the code (conventions) transitions will be much harder.\nWith DokuWiki, Structure Notes are regular wiki pages. They deal with structures just like plain text files do, which I described above.\nStarting Now\nWhat can you expect if you follow the Zettelkasten Method? Expect more, way more results from your efforts. Be persistent and just do it. You will likely get stuck at some point when you cannot figure out how to implement feature X or Y with your tool of choice and get things to work. This will all eventually sort itself out when you went through the motions time and again, and when you remind yourself of the basic principles of a Zettelkasten: you need identifiers as addresses, you need links to create a hypertext, and then get confident through practice. Moving forward is the only way to become something in life. So, get to work. It needs to be done.

You can also use different colours to classify and link concepts or information by topic. However, don’t focus too much on colour coding when you’re in the lecture. It requires time and concentration, so it’s more useful to do most of the highlighting and underlining when you’re revising your notes later.\nUnderline, circle, star, etc. to identify key information, examples, definitions, or other important materials.

It’s important to be consistent so you remember what they represent and can use them easily. Keep a ‘key list’ of frequently used symbols/abbreviations and their meanings so that you can refer to them in the future."},"2-Areas/Productivity/useful-notes":{"slug":"2-Areas/Productivity/useful-notes","filePath":"2 Areas/Productivity/useful notes.md","title":"useful notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"how can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"},"3-Resources/AI-Tooling":{"slug":"3-Resources/AI-Tooling","filePath":"3 Resources/AI Tooling.md","title":"AI Tooling","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Fabric\n\nfabric is an open-source framework for augmenting humans using AI.

Learn how to use ChatGPT to take notes like a pro.\n\n\nFinding ideas and information for note-taking can be quite time-consuming. The good thing, you can use ChatGPT to help you in this process.\nIn this article, we’ll show you how to use ChatGPT to prepare detailed and informative notes easily. Besides, we’ll guide you to create your personalized prompt for note-taking.\nHow to Use ChatGPT for Note-Taking\nUndoubtedly, traditional note-taking is still good, but what if you take a more futuristic approach by using AI for note-taking?\nBy now, you may have heard of ChatGPT due to the buzz it has created in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. There are many things to do with ChatGPT; for this article, we’ll stick to using it for systematic note-taking.\nStep 1. Create a Prompt for Your Topic\nFirstly, you should have the right prompt to feed into ChatGPT. A prompt is a statement or query that guides ChatGPT to produce the desired information. Remember that the more specific your prompt, the more tailored the ChatGPT’s response.\nFor example, if your topic for note-taking is Income Tax Law, a basic prompt could be, “Please provide an in-depth overview of Income Tax Law, the main provisions, and kinds of taxes.”\n\nAs you can see above, ChatGPT provided us with a complex paragraph. However, it might not be the most systematic and reader-friendly format for note-taking. After all, if we all wanted a wall of text, we could use Google, right? So, to get the best possible output, you must improve the prompt for your needs.\nNow that you have a basic understanding, here’s our custom prompt that can help ChatGPT to generate neat and detailed notes:\nAs a [ABC Course Student], I’m preparing notes on the subject/topic [YOUR TOPIC]. I need you to act as an expert professor and provide me with comprehensive and well-structured notes.\nHere are the guidelines for the notes:\n1. Key Terms and Concepts: Include definitions of key terms and insights about main ideas. Use appropriate examples for a better understanding of the topic.\n2. Styling: Use H2 for the main headings and questions and H3 for all the sub-headings. You must include related emojis to make the notes engaging. Use bold and italic formatting for emphasis and clarity.\n3. Questions and Answers: Generate a list of potential questions and detailed answers that someone studying this subject might need to know.\n4. Structure: Summarize the information logically using bulleted or numbered points.\nCondition: Please ensure the notes cover the following topics: [ALL THE TOPICS].\n\nYou must adjust the above prompt to suit your needs. So, if you are preparing notes for a different subject or topic, change the words in square brackets accordingly.\nStep 2. Ask ChatGPT to Prepare the Notes\nNow that you have the prompt, type it into the ChatGPT interface and press Enter.\nBased on your prompt, ChatGPT will construct a detailed set of notes. The best part is that ChatGPT can generate notes far faster than a human, saving you time.\n\nFor this guide, we’re using the free version of ChatGPT. If you have the Plus subscription, you might find the WebPilot or Metaphor Search plugins to be useful.\nStep 3. Review and Refine the Generated Notes\nAs discussed above, ChatGPT is just an AI language model, which may occasionally produce errors or inaccuracies in the generated notes. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully go through the notes and make any necessary corrections or additions.\nTo refine the generated notes, you can always ask ChatGPT to organize them into subcategories, or you can even ask it to summarize the key points.\nNow suppose the output is not enough for your needs; in this case, you can prompt, “The [TOPIC] section is not well-explained in the notes. Please expand it and explain it in a better manner.”.\n\nPrompting is indeed a skill, and if you want to master it, read our prompt crafting guide for beginners once. Once you master prompting, you can quickly improve your notes. For example, you can prompt ChatGPT to include bucket brigades, more examples, and context-based questions in your notes.\nStep 4. Format the Notes in a Note-Taking App\nOnce satisfied with the output, click the copy button and paste the copied output into your preferred note-taking app. This can vary from Microsoft OneNote to Google Keep. To help you better, we’ve shared our views on some useful note-taking apps for different platforms.\n\nOnce you’ve transferred the notes into your note-taking app, it’s entirely up to you how you choose to present them. Also, you can check some of the most effective strategies to master note-taking quickly.\nNow, if you’re excited about formatting your draft notes, there are plenty of ways. For example, you can color grade the main points, use font styling, and add images for better context. We already have a guide on some free AI image generation tools and websites for copyright-free images to give your notes an eye-catchy look.\nHow Can You Improve Your Notes Using ChatGPT?\nSo you have the notes ready, but now what? Do you want to improve them and make them easy to remember? Here are two ways by which you can improve your notes when using ChatGPT:\n1. Layered Note-Taking Method\n\nLayered note-taking is a great way to organize and structure your notes. With this method, you create different layers or levels of information, starting with the most critical points at the top and adding more detailed information as you go down.\nThis lets you quickly look through your notes and easily locate the critical information you need. This method is beneficial when you have much information to cover and want to ensure you effectively capture the essential points.\n2. Question and Answer Method\n\nThe question-and-answer method is another effective way to enrich your notes. This method involves creating questions based on your notes and then using ChatGPT to answer them. This makes your notes more interactive and deepens your understanding of the material.\nFor this, our prompt already includes a condition. Here’s a tip: While using ChatGPT, you can use CONDITIONS to emphasize things you don’t want ChatGPT to miss.\nTips on Using ChatGPT for Note-Taking\nUsing ChatGPT for note-taking can be a game-changer, but there are a few tips you should keep in mind:\n\nBe specific with your prompts: Instead of asking general questions, try to provide specific details or ask for clarification in your prompts. If you’re not a professional, you must avoid these mistakes while prompting for better output.\nSet a context: Providing more information about your needs and what you want to include in your notes will refine the final output from ChatGPT.\nGive ChatGPT a role to play: Whenever you need a detailed and tailored response, ask ChatGPT to play a role. For example, you can ask it to act as a professor, a student, a friend, or anything else.\nAvoid grammatical errors in your prompt: While ChatGPT can understand your query, if it has minor errors, if the grammar mistakes are too much, it’ll be hard to generate the desired response.\nAssign yourself a role: If you find it hard to understand a topic, you can prompt, “I’m a [Role]. Now, explain [TOPIC] to me in the best possible manner.”.\n\nCreate Your Notes From Scratch Using ChatGPT\nWith the acquired skills, you can craft prompts for ChatGPT perfectly. Besides, remember the principle: the level of detail in your prompts determines the depth of your notes.\nOur custom prompt covers all the fundamental aspects for note-taking enthusiasts. So, use our prompts wisely and tailor them to your needs.

Dra en figur till den tomma ytan och vips har du någon som spelar trummor, gitarr eller fiol. Om du vill kan du kombinera de olika stilarna, något som antingen blir njutbart eller rena tortyren för öronen.\nPango Musical March är en betal-app, något som innebär att du slipper irriterande reklam. Det här är definitivt en app som vi kan rekommendera för de yngre barnen.\n\nImage credit: Sago Mini (Image credit: Sago Mini)\nSago Mini Village (50 kronor)\nSago Mini Village kan i korthet beskrivas som en enklare version av Minecraft för yngre barn. Med andra ord bygger du en egen värld med hjälp av klossar, men till skillnad från det svenskutvecklade succéspelet får du nöja dig med att spela på egen hand.\nSom vanligt när det gäller appar från Sago Mini är det fullt med färger och söta figurer, i det här fallet handlar det om massor av tomtar. Så fort du bygger något hus flyttar en ny tomte in och interagerar med omgivningen. Det finns gott om charmiga animationer och överraskningar i den här appen.\nEftersom Sago Mini Village är ett spel utan en massa reklam och köp-inuti-program passar det utmärkt för småbarnsfamiljen.\n\nPango Paper Color (35 kronor)\nI Pango Paper Color tar du del av en magisk värld skapad av papper. Det finns fyra olika scener att välja mellan, däribland en skog och en bondgård. När pappersvärlden har skapats kan du färglägga den med dina fingrar och då väcks objekten till liv.\nPango Paper Color riktar sig först och främst till mindre barn, men det är faktiskt en ganska kul och avkopplande app för hela familjen.\nNär barnen är klara med en scen är det bara att vika ihop pappersvärlden och börja på nästa.\n\nSizzle &amp; Stew (35 kronor)\nSizzle &amp; Stew är en rolig app som låter barnen ta reda på vad man kan göra med mat. \nI centrum står en sengångare och en lama som vill testa allt möjligt, till exempel att mikra en morot till oigenkännlighet eller stoppa in broccoli i ugnen. Om du vill kan de även testa att laga mat i tvättmaskinen, de här två krabaterna äter precis allt!\nSizzle &amp; Stew är en skojfrisk app som barnen kan utforska i sin egen takt med eller utan en förälder bredvid sig. Vem vet, kanske väcks ett livslångt intresse för mat som gör att ditt barn så småningom blir en mästerkock?\n\nToca Life: Office (50 kronor)\nTack vare Toca Life: Office kan dina barn få en föreställning hur det är att jobba på ett kontor. Låt vara att det antagligen är roligare i den virtuella verkligheten än i den verkliga verkligheten.\nFör de minsta barnen räcker det antagligen långt med att flytta på de olika figurerna och se vad som händer. De lite äldre barnen kan använda kaffebryggaren eller kopieringsmaskinen, besöka kafeterian eller leta efter den hemliga utgången.\nVill du dela med dig av dina äventyr kan du använda den inbyggda inspelningsfunktionen. Det här är kort och gott en utmärkt pedagogisk leksak från Toca Boca.\n\nBandimal (50 kronor)\nBandimal är en musikleksak för barn enligt beskrivningen, men det är faktiskt kul även om man är vuxen.\nDu har tre ”slottar” där du sveper fram olika djur som hjälper dig att skapa loopar. Det finns också ett trumspår och några grundläggande effekter. När du har skapat en trudelutt rör sig djuren i takt med musik, vilket är riktigt kul att se.\nBandimal lockar fram det inre barnet i oss och bara det gör appen värd att köpa.\n\nZen Studio (Gratis - erbjuder köp i app)\nZen Studio är en unik och vackert utformad app för målning och färgläggning. I stället för den sedvanliga duken får du ett triangulärt rutnät att måla på. Markerar du en triangel fylls den med vald färg samtidigt som en ton spelas upp. Denna kombination av färgläggning och musik är avslappnande för både barn och vuxna.\nGratisversion är underhållande i sig, men om du skaffar betalversionen kan du spara hur många målningar som helst. Dessutom får du då tillgång till den vita färgen som kan vara bra att ha som suddgummi.\nHar du svårt att skapa på egen hand kan du dra nytta av de medföljande exemplen som visar hur man bygger upp en bild från grunden. \n\nLittle Digits (35 kronor)\nLittle Digits tar hjälp av den stora pekskärmen på iPad för att lära små barn att räkna. Tryck ett antal fingrar på skärmen och vips kommer det upp motsvarande siffra i form av ett sött litet monster. \nFör säkerhets skull kan monstren tala, så om du använder ett finger säger det ”Ett!”, om du använder två fingrar säger det ”Två!” och så vidare. Dessutom får barnen lära sig i vilken ordning som siffrorna kommer, samt grundläggande addition och subtraktion.\nBäst av allt är att Little Digits har stöd för mängder av språk, däribland svenska, engelska och franska. Om du talar ett språk som inte finns inlagt kan du dessutom spela in siffrorna på egen hand, vilket gör appen till ett utmärkt språkverktyg. \n\nMetamorphabet (59 kronor)\nDu är antagligen död på insidan om du inte får ett leende på läpparna när du använder Metamorphabet tillsammans med ditt barn.\nI den här engelskspråkiga appen får vi se animerade bokstäver i alla möjliga former. Till exempel får vi se bokstaven A omvandlas till saker som börjar på just A. B omvandlas till saker som börjar med B och så vidare.\nDet här är en väldigt lekfull app och även om vissa associationer inte fungerar hundraprocentigt är det underbart när man ser hur uppslukat ett barn kan vara av det som visas på skärmen.\n\nToca Nature (50 kronor)\nNär du öppnar Toca Nature är det första du ser en öde värld som flyter i luften. Men med hjälp av dina magiska fingrar kan du skapa höga berg och djupa sjöar. Nästa steg är att plantera träd och vips dyker det upp olika sorters djur.\nGenom att zooma in kan du se fiskar, fåglar, björnar, rävar och vargar som befolkar din lilla värld. Dessa letar efter mat och om du vill kan du hjälpa till att mata dem med bär och andra godsaker.\nMålgruppen är först och främst barn, men det kul även för vuxna personer som har sitt barnasinne kvar. Tyvärr finns det ingen möjlighet att spara sina världar, så du måste börja om från början varje gång du startar appen på nytt. Lyckligtvis går det snabbt att komma i gång, så i slutändan gör det inte så mycket. \n\nFoldify Dinosaurs (50 kronor)\nVi gillar Foldify-apparna som gör det möjligt att skapa figurer på sin iPad, skriva ut dem på papper och till sist vika dem till tredimenionella figurer i verkligheten. \nMed tanke på hur mycket tid vi tillbringar framför skärmarna är det en skön känsla att sitta och vika papper. I fallet med Foldify Dinosaurs är det dinosaurier som ska skapas och vem blir inte glad över att se en lila Tyrannosaurus Rex med en mustach?\nDet finns gott om olika modeller att välja mellan och om du vill kan du även bidra med dina egna genom att ladda upp dina skisser på nätet."},"3-Resources/Beteende/Driving-change":{"slug":"3-Resources/Beteende/Driving-change","filePath":"3 Resources/Beteende/Driving change.md","title":"Driving change","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"What you can do today\nI mentioned “use our actions to signal the need for change” earlier, so I wanted to give you some ideas about what actions you can take using the 7 drivers framework to signal the change you want to see:\nAs a consumer\n\nAs a consumer, you vote with your money.

Get your core industries running (plants, alcohol, meat, meals), and then set up an industry or two that runs in surplus (bone crafting, rock crafts). Get used to the work orders screen so you can stop directly managing those systems (make beds when they get low, always have 100 drinks, only make bone crafts when there are an extra 5 bones, make sure there are 30 mugs, etc). At this point you should only be managing buildings and bedrooms, leaving everything else to your dwarves to manage on their own. Then you pick a new industry (metal smithing, animal husbandry, clothes making) and learn how it runs and what you need to maintain it. Get it on your orders screen, learn a new industry. I typically start military around 50 dwarves with a 4 man squad, and don’t really dive in until 100.\nAfter a couple of runs, you’ll find you have metal smithing running in the first year, and the basics are just a list of stuff to set up when starting a fort.

Textile is also useful for things like ropes, and your dwarves’ clothes will eventually wear out and they’ll get upset over not having shoes or pants, so having at least a small cloth industry is a good idea. Also, if you go whole hog, plant fiber cloth is worth a fair bit, so that’s good for trade too.\n\n\nGet a military together! You’re going to need it someday, may as well start now! Dwarves don’t need any equipment at all to learn wrestling and fistfighting, and wrestling is always a useful skill.

The defense guide is a good way to start, but it goes fully in depth. Here’s an example: I build entirely underground, so the only thing on the surface is a shaft. I surround it with stone walls save for two sides. On one side I channel out a small moat, then I build a bridge across it that can be drawn upward (instead of retract) towards my mineshaft. That way it becomes a wall when I flip the lever in my base. The other direction becomes a long snakey path of cage and spike traps, which only take wood and stone.

Which level are you playing on?\n\n\nChris Mascioli expands on the idea of “leveled thinking,” made famous by David Sklansky in his poker book. Which level are you playing on?\nIt’s commonplace in Magic lingo to hear the term “level” thrown about, almost haphazardly; it is included in phrases such as “get on my level” and “you just got completely leveled” to the title of Chapin’s “Next Level Magic.” However clichÃ©d it may appear, leveled thinking is an intricate area, and a greater understanding of the processes that go on in your (and your opponent’s) mind during the course of a match will lead to a greater overall prowess.\n1. What Is Leveled Thinking?\nThe concept of leveled thinking (to the best of my knowledge) was first written about by David Sklansky in his book “No Limit Hold ‘Em: Theory and Practice” where he defines the different levels one can think at. His definitions of each level are summarized in the following table:\nLevel 0What do I have?Level 1What could my opponent have?Level 2What does my opponent think I have?Level 3What does my opponent think I think he has?Level 4What does my opponent think that I think that he thinks that I have?\nLevel 0 — What do I have?\nIn this level the only thing that matters is what cards are in my hand and what order I should play them in; a player at level 0 is essentially always goldfishing. The important factor to consider at this level is:\nHow do I win this game given the cards available to me?\nThis is the level where one learns the nuts and bolts of playing Magic, and most players eventually advance to level 1. This is the level of play most frequently seen at FNMs\nLevel 1 — What could my opponent have?\nThis is the level where you first actually play the game known as Magic. Your decision process takes into consideration what your opponent can have, and you play in a way which will maximize your chance of winning against the hand you have placed him on. For instance, if you have six mana and the choice between playing Sword of Feast and Famine and Primeval Titan while you’re fairly confident that your opponent has a Mana Leak, your best course of action is to play the Sword (the level 0 player might also choose to play Sword here if, for instance, it would get rid of the last card in his opponent’s hand or kill his [I will use “his” for my singular pronoun every time; if you take issue with this, pretend I used “her” and get on with your life] opponent outright, but never because he’s taking into consideration what his opponent may do). The important factors to consider here are:\nWhat cards can be in my opponent’s deck?\nWhat are the consequences of them having those cards?\nIf he has those cards what can I do?\nThis is the level where the majority of players are at their apex and the level of play you’ll see out of most players in a PTQ.\nLevel 2 — What does my opponent think I have?\nAt this level, the game is no longer about what just you think but begins to incorporate the thought processes of your opponent. It is at this level where players begin to understand the concept of bluffing. (A bluff is when you represent a card you don’t have. For example, if my hand is Think Twice and Gideon Jura, but I make sure to leave at least two Islands and one Plains untapped, I am representing that I have a Dissipate.) It is important to make sure to tell a consistent story with bluffs in order to ensure their believability to an opponent. If for instance, you only leave 1UU open when you have nothing better to do for the turn, your opponent will most likely find your story incredulous and play their spell into your open mana. The important questions to consider at level 2 are:\nDo I want to maximize or minimize the ambiguity of cards in my hand? (The correct answer is almost always to maximize [there are some corner cases where you don’t] and is why most players will tap their basics before their duals.)\nGiven my opponent’s actions last turn, is he continuing to buy my story, or has he already done something to prove himself incredulous?\nShould I stick to my story, or is it time to tell a different tale?\nThis is the level where the top PTQ grinders and lesser pros reside.\nLevel 3 — What does my opponent think I think he has?\nAt this level, the game starts to become quite meta; you are essentially attempting to figure out how your opponent thinks you’re interpreting his actions. Take the role of the villain in the aforementioned Dissipate example: if your opponent is leaving WUU open every turn, he is intending for you to think he has Dissipate. After concluding this, it is then necessary to figure out several other factors:\nWhy does he want me to think he has Dissipate?\nDoes he actually have the Dissipate?\nIf he doesn’t have the Dissipate, what cards is he trying to mask with the illusion of Dissipate?\nLevel 4 — What does my opponent think that I think that he thinks that I have?\nThe articulation of this level would take up too much space to really be productive, but if you’re capable of thinking at this level, I doubt you’re actually reading this article, and a brief description of level 4 thinking will do nothing to help you reach it. There are actually infinite levels of thought, and “each successive level is to think about what your opponent might be thinking on the previous level” (Sklansky, 169).\nOne important note before we go on to look at leveled thinking in action: The most important factor is not what level you operate on, but the proper identification of the level your opponent is operating on. The task of identification, however, cannot be completed without knowing the options, hence the need for the explanation of each level given above.\n2. Leveled Thinking in Action — Wine in Front of Me (WIFOM)\nBefore reading on, it is helpful if you watch the following scene from Princess Bride (slight spoiler if you haven’t seen the movie, but you should still watch it).\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nAside: In case you were involved with the two-week mtgwolf craze that traveled around the MTG Twitterverse, you would often see people (mostly to give the impression that they were quite clever) claiming “WIFOM” and then go on to present circular reasoning (often for almost an hour) on why they were voting to lynch their particular selection.\nThe rules of the game set up in the scene are as follows (in case you’ve seen the movie, please ignore what actually happened for a bit):\n\nÂ There are two cups of wine, one of which contains a deadly poison.\nYour opponent knows which cup has the poison.\nYour opponent places one cup in front of you and one cup in front of him.\nYou must select one cup and drink simultaneously along with your opponent.\nIf you select the cup with the poison, you die.\n\nAs Vizzini immediately points out, the game is “so simple, all [he has] to do is divine from what [he] know[s] of you; are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy’s?” This is a reiteration and confirmation of the last point from the previous section: The identification of your opponent’s level is what is critical here. Now that the task has been given to identify what level your opponent is operating on, it is first necessary to determine what a person would do operating on each level.\nLevel 0\nIf your opponent is thinking on this level, he places the poison in front of you, since he does not remotely consider what you might do or think, so he chooses the default option.\nLevel 1\nIf your opponent is operating on level 1, he will consider that you have the choice of which cup to drink from, and it would be far too obvious to place the poison in front of him.\nLevel 2\nAt this level your opponent will consider the fact that you may think that he is too clever to put the wine in his own glass, so he places the wine in front of himself.\nLevel 3+\nThe reasoning behind each level’s choice is circular and need not be presented (plus, giving the reasoning for levels 0-2 is enough for a proof by induction), but the solution can be summarized in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponent’s levelWhich cup has the poison?0\n|\nYours\n|\n|\n1\n|\nHis\n|\n|\n2\n|\nYours\n|\n|\n3\n|\nHis\n|\n|\n…\n|\n…\n|\n|\nEven\n|\nYours\n|\n|\nOdd\n|\nHis\n|\nÂ The reward for correctly deducing your opponent’s level in this game was being able to live and getting the princess while the penalty for incorrect identification was death. The consequences in Magic aren’t as severe, and the rewards not as desirable (unless Darwin Kastle’s guide to dating is true beexcellent), but misidentification of your opponent’s level can lead to a number of otherwise avoidable losses.\n3. Level Identification\nNow that the importance of proper identification of your opponent’s level has been established, the first logical question is “How do I identify my opponent’s level?” Of course, there’s no simple answer besides making sure to observe their in-game mannerisms and sequencing, but here’s some basic guidelines:\n\nDeck choice: If your opponent is playing a known deck, they are more likely to be a level 1 or 2 player, but this relationship is not particularly strong all the time.\nSleeves: Lack of sleeves on a deck (in a real event) most likely indicate someone who’s new to the game and therefore most likely a level 0.\nShuffling: If your opponent shuffles like this you should probably be wary.\nIf your opponent continually plays into everything possible and spends very little time thinking, they are most likely level 0.\nIf your opponent plays around tricks but leaves essentially no ambiguity as to what’s in their hand, they are most likely level 1.\nHave you ever heard your opponent’s name before? Have they won more than one PTQ or played on several Pro tours? If not, they’re most likely level 0 or 1.\n\n4. How to play against people at different levels\nOnce the important ask of level identification has been completed, it is then necessary to figure out how to use this information in order to help you win. Once an opponent’s level is identified it falls into one of three categories: The same, lower, or higher.\nA. The same level\nIf two players of the same level play against each other, the player with the better technical play and better mastery of that level will be favored. For example, if two level 0s play against each other, the one that is better capable of executing their game plan in order to win will be ahead, or if two players at level 1 are paired, the player who is better able to determine their opponent’s hand will be advantaged. At lower levels of competition, this will be the most likely case, so it is therefore of greater importance to focus on improving aspects of one’s own technical play/mastering the level one is currently at rather than attempting to develop higher levels of thinking.\nB. A lower level\nIf your opponent is at a lower level, it is imperative that you change the level you are operating on to be only one higher than your opponent. Although this stratagem appears unintuitive (Why would you ever not want to take advantage of the levels of thought you spent so long mastering?) there’s a very real reason for it: The level one level above your opponent is the one where you can interact most favorably.\nLet’s say a level 2 player plays against a level 0 player. The level 2 player will spend a considerable amount of thought and effort to bluff the correct spells in each location while their opponent will completely ignore what they are doing and play his cards how he feels like. The level 2 player, after losing the match, will go on to complain to his friends about how he “lost to a noob” and how he had “no respect for anything I was representing.” However, what the level 2 player is missing is that if he were to “lower” himself to level 1 and only focusing on determining what his opponent could have and assembling a game plan based solely on that (compared to what he did, which was focusing a game plan based on something his opponent had no knowledge of) he would have had a much better chance.\nC. A higher level\nThis is the situation you least want to be in, and how outclassed you feel you are will determine how you play out the game. If you think you are relatively close in skill level to your opponent, you should play out your game as you normally would. Your opponent will be advantaged, but there’s not much you can really do but play your best Magic and hope for fortuitous draws or for your opponent to make mistakes that you can capitalize on.\nOn the other hand, if you feel like you are greatly outclassed by your opponent (for example, if I were to be paired against LSV or PV I would most certainly employ this technique), the best bet might be to adopt a modified version of the strategy advocated by Rodman and Nelson in their book “Kill Phil.” Essentially, they advocate a strategy (when playing against players much better than yourself) where rather than get involved in a game where you can be outplayed, you limit your decision tree to a binary one: either fold or go all-in on every hand. By doing this, you force the more experienced players to either have it or get out of the hand and show yourself as a player who can’t be bullied. Although occasionally the more experienced players will “wake up” with a hand and still take all your chips, you are not allowing them to play their best game, which takes some of their advantage away. In order to do the equivalent in Magic, you have to “lower” yourself to play at level 0 and just play your cards with almost no regard to what your opponent could be holding. Statistically you should draw better than your opponent about 50% of the time, and this method allows you to push drawing better than your much more skilled opposition as far as it will carry you and forces them to play a game they don’t want to play: “Do you have it?”\nQuotes:\n[SarcasticRat] some riot grrrl from New Zealand added me on last.fm\n[SarcasticRat] bet brim is jealous\n[snoopster] also, i think i’m as good at drafting as lsv\n\n\nMy wall after the Worlds PWP change:\n\nChris Mascioli\nchrism315 on modo\n@dieplstks on Twitter (you should really follow me)\nI even have a blog (people say it’s too depressing though): dieplstks.tumblr.com"},"3-Resources/Games/Star-Rails/Maxing-clockie-statue":{"slug":"3-Resources/Games/Star-Rails/Maxing-clockie-statue","filePath":"3 Resources/Games/Star Rails/Maxing clockie statue.md","title":"Maxing clockie statue","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"So first off this post will have minor spoilers for of course one thing… Harmony Traileblazer.This post as you can probably see if pretty long but it will be separated in to parts to make it easier to navigate.

These also probably contribute some of the most to the over all Jade total by the end so that another thing going for them.\nElites\n\nSo theses Guys are just kinda annoying. like its not hard to just go IPC Concert and go all Geno route on them but again ALL of the must perish (ps if you have Acheron this is the easiest part) I remember one Specific fight with two waves of TV guys which draged on for YEEARRSSS but outside of that just use your strongest team and guide these guys back to the waking world.\nChests\n\nI Love This Women\nOk I know what your thinking. You think im gonna say that you need Every Single Chest in penacony right. Well… you don’t but that’s going to make another part harder. the way it worked out for me I got the Achivement for opening 300 Chests if that says something. a couple things to know Dream Jigsaw and Eliets don’t count towards the overworld chest count but it does count towards total chest open and I THINK The sub worlds in the Grand Theater don’t count either but idk. you get 60/120/180 buckes per chest depending on the rareity and probably gives The most jades out of everything here. So pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz pull Topaz\nQuests\n\nYou knew it was coming side quests. Do them their should be a couple in the quest menu that give 360 bucks and then theirs also the all the fate atlus ones which also give the same amount. btw doing all of these takes a couple Hours and that’s with mashing sooo yea clear up your Saturday or wait like a week to finish these up. one more thing I didn’t pay attention to the stories of all of them but I did for the ends of them so here’s what happens in like 4 of them One of the people almost comits ALT f4 in their emo scape :( one of them was a tyrannical ruler in belebog in some form and one of them was a former geinus society member.\nEmo-gencies\n\nNow these are the last two thing really Grind my Gears (like the word play im going for yea I know it sucks) but seriously tho these suck so around the safe sections of the maps theirs these people with wrenches where the clockwork symbole should be and that means their having an Emo-gency. there spred out so its hard enough to find some of these flipper floppers but… you remeber how the emotion gears yea you need the coresponding gear to even start the quest and these are basicaly a mini side quest with normally like one or two things you need to do. these each give 180 bucks which means save these for the end of the marathon, like 10 or less statue levels remaning.\nB.I.R.D.S\n\nNow… I HATE THESE FUCKERS now I know thats harsh their cute and sometimes gives a funny little quip of dialog that may make you exhale out of your nose a bit. But After 90 OF THEM you start to go a little mad silly even. I hope you were looking for these pidgons during the story like I didn’t because you need to colect ten in each of the 9 maps in the Dream Scape for a Grand Total OF 1,620 bucks… which if you didn’t notice is NOT EVEN THREE LEVELS and the worst part is if you skip one of these you have to subsitute the 180 your missing out on with an Emo-gency or like 3 more chesets on top of the 300 you alredy got…\nsome tips the gambaling tokens you can buy (the ones firefly gave you) can be given to the biggest birds to drop a pin on a birds location and turn your sound affect volume and music down because the small birds make a little chirping sound. look up alot because these savages like hiding in high places. and if you have Acheron, Sparkle, Fu xuan, Seele, the Watch Maker, Huo Huo, Dr. Ratio, and Robin in that order of priority USE THEM because your going to wish enemies didn’t exsits while surching for these &quot;&quot;&quot;Birds&quot;&quot;&quot; oh and one last thing one of these on Dew Light Pavilion is locked behind a quest : ) (Edit: the quest also has like 9 chest in it that All give clockie bucks that aren’t marked on the map… for some reason. Talk to the dude near the red door on second floor to the right and he’ll unlock it and start the outsourcer quest)\nThe Results\n\nSo (again 2nd person) You spent Hours scrougung up all the money in the world to fully level Clockie Statue…what do you get well first off you get the thing you started this all for E.. 5 you also get a [SHOT] ton of Relic lightcone and character levelup matz and.. MOST importantly around 20-40 pulls depending on how much of this was alredy done before hand. ANNNNNNNDD THATS IT\nMY OPINON!!!!!!\nI see the vision but this SUCKS bro like I get it in the last two reagions it was pretty easy to get like E3 or 4 by the end of the Story if you didn’t spend it on fucking credits or something like that and they want you to interact with the World of Penecony and the world is nice… BUT 10 HOURS WORTH OF INTERACTING IS NOT OK and its not like you get exclusively E5 see the section above but you get those by PROXY of doing every thing and remeber 10 HOURS FOR E5 and im not saying I HAATTEED my time but it just dragged on for HOURS AND HOURS that after it was done I wanted to just go for a walk… But becaues it was like 9:00 I started writing this up insted.\nSo I Hope this helped and may your Giathra Triclops Close her Eyes Thrice.\nReferences\nwww.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1cqwi1i/maxing_out_the_clockie_statue_the_journey/"},"3-Resources/Hus/Japandi-Style-Serenity-in-Minimalism-and-Functionality---Smart-Decor":{"slug":"3-Resources/Hus/Japandi-Style-Serenity-in-Minimalism-and-Functionality---Smart-Decor","filePath":"3 Resources/Hus/Japandi Style Serenity in Minimalism and Functionality - Smart Decor.md","title":"Japandi Style Serenity in Minimalism and Functionality - Smart Decor","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nWhen it comes to interior design, blending different styles can create a unique and harmonious look.

Torka, blöta vintrar, mossinvasion och hårda fotbollsdrabbningar – inte konstigt att gräsmattan blir trött ibland. Bästa rådet för att slippa vårda mattan som en intensivvårdspatient är att från början välja en tålig gräsfröblandning. Men är gräsmattan redan på plats är det lite sent påtänkt. Däremot kan man successivt välja tåligare fröblandningar att stödså. Här följer första hjälpen när gräsmattan är i knipa.\nMossa i gräsmattan\n\nUttorkad gräsmatta\n\nVi har ett brett sortiment för smart bevattning. Vattenspridaren Monsoon kan ställas in med precission så att bara den nödvändiga ytan bevattnas.\nGräs är mycket torktåliga. De kan se gula och vissna ut, men hämtar sig när regnet kommer – oftast. Om du skämt bort din gräsmatta genom att vattna fel (ofta och lite åt gången) har gräset ytliga, bortskämda rötter som klarar torka sämre. Men en robust gräsmatta som vattnas sällan eller inte alls är tålig och klarar torkan bra – även om den ser svedd ut ett tag. Om det bara regnar litegrand, passa då på att vattna precis efteråt. Första vattnet som kommer rinner nämligen rakt igenom en uttorkad jord. Därför kommer gräsrötterna att suga åt sig varje millimeter du vattnar ut efter ett lättare regn. När gräset får vatten och åter grönskar, låt det hämta sig genom att växa till 5-7 cm längd innan du klipper. \nFörsvagad – skadegörare?\n\nPingborrens larver är lätta att känna igen med sitt bruna huvud och den välvda, bleka kroppen.\nOm gräsmattan utan synbarliga skäl växer dåligt, särskilt fläckvis kan det vara larver i jorden som äter av rötterna. Ett tecken är att fåglar håller till på gräsmattan och pickar i sig föda. Ibland kan man lyfta upp sjok av fördärvad gräsmatta som lossnat från jorden. Angreppen är vanligast på lätta jordar och det finns flera slags insektslarver som gillar gräsrötter. Vanligast är pingborren och trägårdsborren. De är skalbaggelarver som känns igen på sitt bruna huvud och en böjd, fet, gulvit kropp. Dessa larver bekämpas effektivt biologiskt med Nemagräs som är nematoder, en slags små maskar, som oskadliggör skalbaggelarver.\nFörsvagad – inga skadegörare\n\nOm du inte kan se några larver eller små skalbaggar som svärmar (flyger flera tillsammans lågt ovan gräsmattan under sensommaren), kan gräsmattan lida av syrebrist. Det är vanligt om jorden är alltför kompakt. Ett säkert tecken är att ytvatten inte rinner undan utan blir stående efter skyfall. Jorden behöver luftas så att rötterna kan bryta igenom och nå längre ner i jordlagert. Det görs med en vertikalskärare (finns att hyra) som gör lodräta luftgångar. Därefter dressas jorden med mullrik kompost eller dressjord, gödslas och vattnas. \nGräsmattan kan också lida av näringsbrist, följ i så fall våra allmänna råd för gräsmattan så kommer den att grönska på nytt efter någon månad.\nGul och blek efter vintern\nDet är normalt. Ett kompakt snötäcke ger syrebrist precis som ömsom kyla och töväder ger en blöt och syrefattig miljö. Kylan ger också en uttorkande effekt och så kallad isbränna kan gå hårt åt en gräsmatta, då fuktig väderlek varvas med minusgrader. Vintern är med andra ord inte gräsmattans favoritperiod. Var tidigt ute och gödsla när ljuset och vårvärmen kommer, så får gräset en kickstart och grönskar snabbt. Om gräsmattan fläckvis inte återhämtat sig kan det bi nädvändigt att stödså dessa partier (se nedan).\nVita mögelfläckar efter vintern\n\nFläckarna kan dyka upp redan under en blöt och kall senhöst. Man ser ljusrosa eller vita fläckar här och var. Det är mycel av svampen snömögel. En snörik, blöt vinter och en kall vår gynnar svampen. Minska angreppet genom att ta bort snödrivor som inte smält bort. Gödsla inte för sent på sensommaren, vilket lockar gräset att växa vidare och svampen att invadera. Räfsa bort angripna partier och släng i soporna.\nHäxringar – små svampar i cirkel\n\nFenomenet med de små hattsvamparna som växer i cirkel kallas häxring och orsakas av flera svamparter. Svampens underjordiska rottrådar växer utåt i radier, därför vidgas cirkeln med åren. Vid anläggning av en gräsmatta är det viktigt att gamla rötter och stubbrester tas bort eftersom svampar gillar cellulosan från bark och vedämnen. Har du väl fått in dessa svampar (vars mycel kan gå meterdjupt ner i jorden), gäller det att gynna gräset genom riklig kvävegödsling med exempelvis hönsgödsel. Man kan också använda biologisk bekämpning med Binab som består av naturliga trichodermasvampar som effektivt försvagar hattsvamparnas mycel.\nFör mycket ogräs\n\nRensa bort ogräsen när de blommar. Då är roten som mest försvagad och du hindrar samtidigt att ogräset sprider sig med frön.\n \nHär gäller att gynna gräset genom att regelbundet (ca tre gånger per säsong med 6-7 veckors mellanrum) gödsla med hönsgödsel eller allgödsel. Handrensning behövs också. Rensa efter regn, då marken är fuktig och ogräset lättare släpper taget. Klöver är lätt att dra upp när den blommar; ta tag i blomknoppen så följer revorna med. Maskrosjärnet är bästa metoden att få bort maskrosorna. Läs mer om hur man bekämpar maskrosor.\nKala fläckar\n\nVälj en robust gräsfröblandning till kala fläckar. \nKala fläckar behöver kompletteras med nya gräsfrön, så kallad stödsådd. Stödså med en tålig grässort. Kratta eller rensa bort  det döda gräset  och luckra upp jorden. Jämna till ytan, eventuellt med mer jord. Vattna rejält och så ut fröna. Tryck till så att de får ordentlig kontakt med den fuktiga jordytan. Se till att sådden hålls fuktig tills fröna grott. En fiberduk över ger ett fuktigt och varmt klimat som påskyndar groningen.\nDu kanske också vill läsa:\nFoto: Awewewe, Karin Elmberg, Nilfanion och Linda Sandström m fl."},"3-Resources/Hus/Silverfiskar":{"slug":"3-Resources/Hus/Silverfiskar","filePath":"3 Resources/Hus/Silverfiskar.md","title":"Silverfiskar","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Exakt så här gjorde vi mer eller mindre varje dag i sex veckor…\n\n​Vi tog bort golvmunstycket och dammsög en gång om dagen med högsta styrkan i alla skrymslen och vrån och längs med alla lister.\nSedan sprayade vi in en droppe olja i dammsugarskaftet / teleskopröret för att hålla eventuella överlevare kvar i påsen.\nEfter det vädrade vi en kort stund och sprayade sedan en enda droppe i varje rum, direkt på en av rödcederbitarna vi hade lagt ut på golvet.​\n\nReferences\nsilverfisk.nu/\nstick.se/silverfisk/rodceder/rodcederpaket-forvara/\nrodceder.se/products/langsprotad-silverfisk-bekampningspaket"},"3-Resources/Investment/Investeringar":{"slug":"3-Resources/Investment/Investeringar","filePath":"3 Resources/Investment/Investeringar.md","title":"Investeringar","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\ninvestor\nembracer\nlundberg\nevolution\nfortnox\n"},"3-Resources/Köpa/Köpa":{"slug":"3-Resources/Köpa/Köpa","filePath":"3 Resources/Köpa/Köpa.md","title":"Köpa","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Parfym\nSkor\nÅtervinningskassar\nwww.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RKFBT6/\nwww.saddler.se/p/valle-bag-midbrown\nwww.bitmapbooks.com/collections/all-books/products/the-crpg-book-a-guide-to-computer-role-playing-games\niqunix.store/collections/iqunix-mechanical-keyboards/products/zx75-gravity-wave"},"3-Resources/Mat-och-Dryck/Bakning":{"slug":"3-Resources/Mat-och-Dryck/Bakning","filePath":"3 Resources/Mat och Dryck/Bakning.md","title":"Bakning","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Väg istället för att ta decilitermått\nLåt brödet vila i ugnen, stäng av ugnen och öppna upp lite\nAnvänd en stektermometer för att veta när brör är klart\n\nVetebröd är färdiga när de har en innertemperatur på 96–98 °C.\n\n\nRågbröd ska ha en innertemperaturen på 99–100 °C.*\n"},"3-Resources/Mat-och-Dryck/Drinkar":{"slug":"3-Resources/Mat-och-Dryck/Drinkar","filePath":"3 Resources/Mat och Dryck/Drinkar.md","title":"Drinkar","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Kladdkaka-shot\nIngredienser\n\n3 cl Licor 43\n1.5 cl gräddlikör\nChokladmjölk\n\nTillredning\n\n Mät upp Licor 43, gräddlikör och chokladmjölk i en shaker.\n Skaka.\n Fukta översta kanten av ett shotglas med chokladmjölk och strö på ett lätt lager socker.

Through this retrospective lens, we gain insights into the broader patterns and purposes that have emerged in our lives.\nWhatever you do, don’t live on autopilot. It can lead to a life of boredom, dissatisfaction and mediocrity. We may never find meaning or fulfilment if we are not living our lives intentionally. Live on purpose. Be more deliberate about what you are doing or why you are doing it.\n“To dare is to lose one’s footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself,” he wrote. Kierkegaard encouraged his readers to take personal and full responsibility for creating meaning in their own lives. He encouraged taking personal responsibility for one’s choices and actions.\n“The unhappy person is never present to themself because they always live in the past or the future.” — Soren Kierkegaard\n“The most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly the one you’ll never have,” he said.\nKierkegaard’s insight suggests that true happiness lies in cultivating a state of presence, where one focuses on the present.\nTo experience the richness of your immediate surroundings, engage with your current relationships and activities, and find contentment in the present moment, let go of excessive attachment to the past or the future.\nHe believed that grappling with anxiety and confronting the uncertainties of life is an essential part of the human condition. Rather than avoiding or suppressing these feelings, embrace them and recognise them as opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery.\nReferences\nmedium.com/personal-growth/s%C3%B8ren-kierkegaards-7-most-powerful-ideas-on-finding-meaning-in-life-9f482b4c53a8"},"3-Resources/Om-krisen-kommer":{"slug":"3-Resources/Om-krisen-kommer","filePath":"3 Resources/Om krisen kommer.md","title":"Om krisen kommer","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nMat- och vattenberedskap:\n\nAnvänd enkla köksalternativ som enkellågiga kök eller stormkök.\nFörvara vatten i dunkar och ha våtservetter för hygien.\n\n\nKommunikationsberedskap:\n\nRadio är viktigt, men en vanlig batteriradio är tillräcklig för en vecka.\n\n\nDubbelt inköp för beredskap:\n\nTillämpa 50 procentsregeln för matinköp för att ha marginaler vid kris.\n\n\nSlutsats:\n\nKrisberedskap bör vara enkel och praktisk för att vara effektiv.

But be warned, if you are looking to caption hundreds of photos, it’s still gonna take some time. To be clear, that means I am saying this method is not good for captioning truly large datasets with tens of thousands of images. Unless you are a masochist.\nSometimes I say “tag” and sometimes “caption”. I was going to go through and fix it all, but I had captioning to do, so maybe I will make it uniform later.\nI do not consider this document “finished”. There is so much to learn, and the AI space is moving so fast, that it will likely never be finished. However, I will try to expand and alter this document as necessary.\nMy experience has primarily been with LoRA training, but some of the aspects here are applicable to all types of training.\nWHO IS THIS DOCUMENT FOR\nI hope this document can be helpful to anyone who is somewhat seriously interested in training their own models in Stable Diffusion using their own datasets. If your goal is to quickly teach your face to a model, there are much better guides available which will have you up and running in a flash. But if your goal is to go a bit deeper, explore training in more depth, perhaps you can add this document to your resources.\nDATASET\nObtaining a good dataset is talked about extensively elsewhere, so I’ve only included the most important parts:\n\n\nhigh quality input means high quality output\n\n\nmore quantity and more variety is better\n\n\nIf you are forced to choose between quality and quantity, quality always wins.\n\n\nUpscale as a last resort, avoid it if possible. When I am forced to upscale, I use LDSR via Automatic1111.\n\n\nPREPARATION\nDepending on how and what you are training, you may need to crop the photos to a specific width and height. Other types of training will bucket images into various sizes and do not require cropping. Look into what is required for the method of training you are doing, the model you are training on, and the program you are using to train your model with.\nCAPTIONING – GENERAL NOTES\nThe following recommendations are based on my experiments, my background work with other datasets, reading subject-matter papers, and borrowing from other successful approaches.\nAvoid automated captioning, for now.\n\n\nBLIP and deepbooru are exciting, but I think it is a bit early for them yet.\n\n\nI often find mistakes and extremely repetitive captions, which take awhile to clean up.\n\n\nThey struggle with context and with relative importance.\n\n\nI think it is faster to manually caption, rather than fix mistakes that BLIP/deepbooru made and still have to manually caption.\n\n\nCaption in the same manner you prompt.\n\n\nCaptioning and prompting are related.\n\n\nRecognize how you typically prompt. Verbose sentences? Short descriptions? Vague? Detailed?\n\n\nCaption in a similar style and verbosity as you tend to when prompting.\n\n\nFollow a set structure per concept.\n\n\nFollowing a structure makes the process easier on you, and although I have no objective evidence, my intuition says that using a consistent structure to describe your dataset will benefit the learning process.\n\n\nYou might have a structure you use for photographs and another structure you use for illustrations. But try to avoid mixing and matching structures when captioning a single dataset.\n\n\nI have explained the structure I generally use below, which can be used as an example.\n\n\nCaptions are like variables you can use in your prompts.\n\nEverything you describe in a caption can be thought of as a variable that you can play with in your prompt. This has two implications:\n\n\n\nYou want to describe as much detail as you can about anything that isn’t the concept you are trying to implicitly teach. In other words, describe everything that you want to become a variable. Example: If you are teaching a specific face but want to be able to change the hair color, you should describe the hair color in each image so that “hair color” becomes one of your variables.\n\n\nYou don’t want to describe anything (beyond a class level description) that you want to be implicitly taught. In other words, the thing you are trying to teach shouldn’t become a variable. Example: If you are teaching a specific face, you should not describe that it has a big nose. You don’t want the nose size to be variable, because then it isn’t that specific face anymore.However, you can still caption “face” if you want to, which provides context to the model you are training. This does have some implications described in the following point.\n\n\nLeveraging classes as tags\n\nThere are two concepts here.\n\n\n\nUsing generic class tags will bias that entire class towards your training data. This may or may not be desired depending on what your goals are.\n\n\nUsing generic class tags provides context to the learning process. Conceptually, it is easier to learn what a “face” is when the model already has a reasonable approximation of “face”.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to bias the entire class of your model towards your training images, use broad class tags rather than specific tags. Example: If you want to teach your model that every man should look like Brad Pitt, your captions should contain the tag “man” but should not be more specific than that. This influences your model to produce a Brad Pitt looking man whenever you use the word “man” in your prompt. This also allows your model to draw on and leverage what it already knows about the concept of “man” while it is training.\n\n\nIf you want to reduce the impact of your training on the entire class, include specific tags and de-emphasize class tags. Example: If you want to teach your model that only “ohwxman” should look like Brad Pitt, and you don&#039;t want every &quot;man&quot; to look like Brad Pitt you would not use &quot;man&quot; as a tag, only tagging it with “ohwxman”. This reduces the impact of your training images on the tag “man”, and strongly associates your training images with “ohwxman”. Your model will draw on what it knows about “ohwxman”, which is practically nothing *see note*, thus building up knowledge almost solely from your training images which creates a very strong association.\n\n\nNOTE This is simplified for the sake of understanding. This would actually be tokenized into two tokens, “ohwx” and “man”, but these tokens would be strongly correlated for training purposes, which should still reduce the impact on the overall class of “man” when compared to training with “man” as a token in the caption. The math it all is quite complex and well beyond the scope here.\n\n\nConsistent Captioning\n\n\nUse consistent captions across all of your training. This will help you better consistently invoke your concept when prompting. I use a program to aid me with this, ensuring that I always use the same captions.\n\n\nUsing inconsistent tags across your dataset is going to make the concept you are trying to teach harder for SD to grasp as you are essentially forcing it to learn both the concept and the different phrasings for that concept. It’s much better to have it just learn the concept under a single term.\n\n\nFor example, you probably don’t want to have both “legs raised in air” and “raised legs” if you are trying to teach one single concept of a person with their legs up in the air. You want to be able to consistently invoke this pose in your prompt, so choose one way to caption it.\n\n\nAvoid Repetition\n\n\nTry to avoid repetition wherever possible. Similar to prompting, repeating words increases the weighting of those words.\n\n\nAs an example, I often find myself repeating the word “background” too much. I might have three tags that say “background” (Example: simple background, white background, lamp in background). Even though I want the background to have low weight, I’ve unintentionally increased the weighting quite a bit. It would be better to combine these or reword them (Example: simple white background with a lamp).\n\n\nTake Note of Ordering\n\n\nAgain, just like with prompting, order matters for relative weighting of tags.\n\n\nHaving a specific structure/order that you generally use for captions can help you maintain relative weightings of tags between images in your dataset, which should be beneficial to the training process.\n\n\nHaving a standardized ordering makes the whole captioning process faster as you become familiar with captioning in that structure.\n\n\nUse Your Models Existing Knowledge to Your Advantage\n\n\nYour model already produces decent results and reasonably understands what you are prompting. Take advantage of that by captioning with words that already work well in your prompts.\n\n\nYou want to use descriptive words, but if you use words that are too obscure/niche, you likely can’t leverage much of the existing knowledge. Example: you could say &quot;sarcrastic&quot; or you could say &quot;mordacious&quot;. SD has some idea of what &quot;sarcastic&quot; conveys, but it likely has no clue what &quot;mordacious&quot; is.\n\n\nYou can also look at this from the opposite perspective. If you were trying to teach the concept of “mordacious”, you might have a dataset full of images that convey “sarcrastic” and caption them with both the tags “sarcastic” and “mordacious” side by side (so that they are close in relative weighting).\n\n\nCAPTIONING – STRUCTURE\nI use this mainly for people / characters, so it might not be quite as applicable to something like fantasy landscapes, but perhaps it can give some inspiration.\nI want to emphasize again that I am not saying this is the only or best way to caption. This is just how I have found success with my own captions on my own datasets. My goal is simply to share what I do and why, and you are free to take as much or little inspiration from it as you want.\nGeneral format\n\n &lt;Type/Perspective/“Of a…”&gt;    &lt;Background/Location&gt; \n\nGlobals\n\nThis is where I would stick a rare token (e.g. “ohwx”) that I want heavily associated with the concept I am training, or anything that is both important to the training and uniform across the dataset Examples: man, woman, anime\n\nType/Perspective/“of a…”\n\n\nBroad descriptions of the image to supply context. I usually do this in “layers”.\n\n\nWhat is it? Examples: photograph, illustration, drawing, portrait, render, anime.\n\n\nOf a… Examples: woman, man, mountain, trees, forest, fantasy scene, cityscape\n\n\nWhat type of X is it (x = choice above)? Examples: full body, close up, cowboy shot, cropped, filtered, black and white, landscape, 80s style\n\n\nWhat perspective is X from? Examples: from above, from below, from front, from behind, from side, forced perspective, tilt-shifted, depth of field\n\n\nAction Words\n\n\nDescriptions of what the main subject is doing or what is happening to the main subject, or general verbs that are applicable to the concept in the image. Describe in as much detail as possible, with a combination of as many verbs as you want.\n\n\nThe goal is to make all the actions, poses, and whatever else active that is happening into variables (as described in point 3 of “Captioning – General”) so that, hopefully, SD is better able to learn the main concept in a general sense rather than only learning the main concept doing specific actions.\n\n\nUsing a person as an example: standing, sitting, leaning, arms above head, walking, running, jumping, one arm up, one leg out, elbows bent, posing, kneeling, stretching, arms in front, knee bent, lying down, looking away, looking up, looking at viewer\n\n\nUsing a flower as an example: wilting, growing, blooming, decaying, blossoming\n\n\nSubject Descriptions\n\n\nAs much description about the subject as possible, without describing the main concept you are trying to teach. Once again, think of this as picking out everything that you want to be a variable in your prompt.\n\n\nUsing a person as an example: white hat, blue shirt, silver necklace, sunglasses, pink shoes, blonde hair, silver bracelet, green jacket, large backpack\n\n\nUsing a flower as an example: pink petals, green leaves, tall, straight, thorny, round leaves\n\n\nNotable Details\n\n\nI use this as a sort of catch-all for anything that I don’t think is quite “background” (or something that is background but I want to emphasize) but also isn’t the main subject.\n\n\nNormally the part of the caption going in this spot is unique to one or just a few training images.\n\n\nI predominately use short captions in Danbooru-style, but if I need to describe something more complex I put it here.\n\n\nFor example, in a photo at a beach I might put “yellow and blue striped umbrella partially open in foreground”.\n\n\nFor example, in a portrait I might put “he is holding a cellphone to his ear”.\n\n\nBackground / Location\n\n\nFairly self-explanatory. Be as descriptive as possible about what is happening in the images background. I tend to do this in a few “layers” as well, narrowing down to specifics, which helps when captioning several photos.\n\n\nFor example, for a beach photo I might put (separated by the three “layers”):\n\n\n\n\nOutdoors, beach, sand, water, shore, sunset\n\n\nSmall waves, ships out at sea, sandcastle, towels\n\n\nthe ships are red and white, the sandcastle has a moat around it, the towels are red with yellow stripes\n\n\nLoose Associations\n\n\nThis is where I put any final loose associations I have with the image.\n\n\nThis could be anything that pops up in my head, usually “feelings” that I feel when looking at the image or concepts I feel are portrayed, really anything goes here as long as it exists in the image.\n\n\nKeep in mind this is for loose associations. If the image is very obviously portraying some feeling, you may want it tagged closer to the start of the caption for higher weighting.\n\n\nFor example: happy, sad, joyous, hopeful, lonely, sombre\n\n\nTHE BOORU DATASET TAG MANAGER\nYou’ve got a dataset. You’ve decided on a structure. You’re ready to start captioning. Now it’s time for the magic part of the workflow: BooruDatasetTagManager (BDTM). This handy piece of software will do two extremely important things for us which greatly speeds up the workflow:\n\n\nTags are preloaded in *\\tags\\list.tag, which can be edited. This gives us auto-complete for common tags, allows us to double-click common tags so we don’t need to type it out, etc.\n\n\nIt enables you to easily be consistent with your captioning by displaying already-used captions so that you can easily add it to an image without typing it out.\n\n\nAs an added bonus, it helps when you’re forgetful. Sometimes I forget that standing with most of your weight on one foot (but with both feet on the ground) is called contrapposto. But I have it saved as a tag, and usually remember it starts as “contra”. Thankfully auto-complete is there to save the day. Seriously, having all of these tags at your fingertips is a huge difference from trying to remember a bunch of tags or having booru sites open in other tabs.\nTHE PROCESS\n\n\nPlace all of your images in a folder and then navigate there in the BDTM UI, selecting the folder with your images.\n\n\nAt the top, press “View” and then “Show preview” to see the selected image.\n\n\nIf you have any globally applicable tags, add them on the right side of the UI. You can select where these global tags appear (top, bottom, or at a specific position in the list).\n\n\nSelect your image on the left and begin adding tags, remembering to follow you structure as best as possible. As you type, the tags will show auto-complete options from the list.tag file which you can select, or you can type in your own custom ones.\n\n\nEach tag you have used anywhere in that dataset will show on the right side (under “All tags”). You can double-click a tag from the “All tags” section to apply it to the currently selected image, saving tons of time and ensuring tag consistency across your dataset\n\n\nOnce all of your images are tagged, go back to the start and do it again. This time look at your tags and make sure they are ordered appropriately according to the weighting you want (you can drag them to reorder if necessary), make sure they follow your structure, check for missing tags, etc.\n\n\nAnd that’s it. I patiently look at every image and add any tags I think are applicable, aiming to have at least one to two tags in each of the categories of my prompt structure. I usually have between 8 and 20 tags per image, though sometimes I might have even more.\nOver time, I have edited the provided list.tag file removing many of the tags I’ll never use and adding a bunch of tags that I use frequently, making the whole process even easier.\nFULL EXAMPLE OF A SINGLE IMAGE\nThis is an example of how I would caption a single image I picked off of safebooru. We will assume that I want to train the style of this image and associate it with the tag “ohwxStyle”, and we will assume that I have many images in this style within my dataset.\nSample Image: safebooru.org/index.php\n\n\nGlobals: ohwxStyle\n\n\nType/Perspective/Of a: anime, drawing, of a young woman, full body shot, from side\n\n\nAction words: sitting, looking at viewer, smiling, head tilt, holding a phone, eyes closed\n\n\nSubject description: short brown hair, pale pink dress with dark edges, stuffed animal in lap, brown slippers\n\n\nNotable details: sunlight through windows as lighting source\n\n\nBackground/location: brown couch, red patterned fabric on couch, wooden floor, white water-stained paint on walls, refrigerator in background, coffee machine sitting on a countertop, table in front of couch, bananas and coffee pot on table, white board on wall, clock on wall, stuffed animal chicken on floor\n\n\nLoose associations: dreary environment\n\n\nAll together: ohwxStyle, anime, drawing, of a young woman, full body shot, from side, sitting, looking at viewer, smiling, head tilt, holding a phone, eyes closed, short brown hair, pale pink dress with dark edges, stuffed animal in lap, brown slippers, sunlight through windows as lighting source, brown couch, red patterned fabric on couch, wooden floor, white water-stained paint on walls, refrigerator in background, coffee machine sitting on a countertop, table in front of couch, bananas and coffee pot on table, white board on wall, clock on wall, stuffed animal chicken on floor, dreary environment\nThe best part is, I can set all of those “global” ones in BDTM to apply to all of my images. I’ve now also got all of those tags ready just a double-click away, so if my next image is also a full body shot, from the side, sitting… I just double-click it. Much easier than typing it out again.\nTRAIN\nTime to start training! I don’t have much to write here other than experiment. There is no golden number of steps or guaranteed results when it comes to training. That’s why it’s fun to experiment. And now you can experiment knowing that you have an extremely high quality dataset, allowing you to really hone-in on the appropriate training settings.\nMISC THOUGHTS AND REFERENCES\n\n\nI always try to remind myself that we are just gently guiding the learning process, not controlling it. Your captions help point the learning process in the right direction, but the captions are not absolute. Inferences will be made on things in the image that weren’t captioned, associations will be made between tags and parts of the image you didn’t intend, etc. Try to guide, but trust in the training and the quality of your images as well.\n\n\nDanbooru/safebooru tags are great. I mean, there’s a lot of trash ones that hold no meaning, but take a look at the Danbooru wiki for tag group “Posture” as an example. Dozens of specific words for different arm positions, leg positions, etc. You might just find that one specific word you’ve been searching for that describes the style/pose/lighting/whatever by crawling through the danbooru tags and wiki. Maybe you’ve always wanted someone posing with that ballerina style foot where the toes are pointed downwards. Well it’s called plantar flexion; thanks danbooru tags.\n\n\nReferences\nwww.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/118spz6/captioning_datasets_for_training_purposes/"},"3-Resources/Stable-Diffusion/Captioning-images":{"slug":"3-Resources/Stable-Diffusion/Captioning-images","filePath":"3 Resources/Stable Diffusion/Captioning images.md","title":"Captioning images","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"github.com/YuxinWenRick/hard-prompts-made-easy\ngithub.com/THUDM/CogVLM/blob/main/assets/compare-min.png"},"3-Resources/Stable-Diffusion/Fine-tuning":{"slug":"3-Resources/Stable-Diffusion/Fine-tuning","filePath":"3 Resources/Stable Diffusion/Fine-tuning.md","title":"Fine-tuning","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"THIS is probably the reason why your training in Kohya is taking ages, and here are some tips to solve it\nTL;DR:\nSettings that use more VRAM than you have can cause the trainer to start using RAM, which is significantly slower.\nBackground\nA few months ago, Nvidia released a driver update allowing applications that consume all available VRAM to start using RAM to avoid crashes. This ‘feature’ can mask scenarios where the trainer consumes more VRAM than your GPU has, significantly slowing down the training process.\nRecommendations\n\n\nMonitor VRAM Usage: At the start of a training session, check the task manager for shared memory usage.

AI also has those attributes. Note that they are not intrinsically evil. They are all double-edged swords, with the potential to do either good or ill.
